       "['When it Was the Ninth Night,\\n\\n\\x0cShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the\\nyoung woman, the sorceress, took in hand some of the tarn water\\nand spake over it words not to be understood, the fishes lifted\\ntheir heads and stood up on the instant like men, the spell on\\nthe people of the city having been removed. What was the lake\\nagain became a crowded capital; the bazars were thronged with\\nfolk who bought and sold; each citizen was occupied with his own\\ncalling and the four hills became islands as they were whilome.\\nThen the young woman, that wicked sorceress, returned to the King\\nand (still thinking he was the negro) said to him, O my love!\\nstretch forth thy honoured hand that I may assist thee to rise.\"\\n\"Nearer to me,\" quoth the King in a faint and feigned tone. She\\ncame close as to embrace him when he took up the sword lying hid\\nby his side and smote her across the breast, so that the point\\nshowed gleaming behind her back. Then he smote her a second time\\nand cut her in twain and cast her to the ground in two halves.\\nAfter which he fared forth and found the young man, now freed\\nfrom the spell, awaiting him and gave him joy of his happy\\nrelease while the Prince kissed his hand with abundant thanks.\\nQuoth the King, \"Wilt thou abide in this city or go with me to my\\ncapital?\" Quoth the youth, \"O King of the age, wottest thou not\\nwhat journey is between thee and thy city?\" \"Two days and a\\nhalf,\" answered he, whereupon said the other, \"An thou be\\nsleeping, O King, awake! Between thee and thy city is a year\\'s\\nmarch for a well girt walker, and thou haddest not come hither in\\ntwo days and a half save that the city was under enchantment. And\\nI, O King, will never part from thee; no, not even for the\\ntwinkling of an eye.\" The King rejoiced at his words and said,\\n\"Thanks be to Allah who hath bestowed thee upon me! From this\\nhour thou art my son and my only son, for that in all my life I\\nhave never been blessed with issue.\" Thereupon they embraced and\\njoyed with exceeding great joy; and, reaching the palace, the\\nPrince who had been spell bound informed his lords and his\\ngrandees that he was about to visit the Holy Places as a pilgrim,\\nand bade them get ready all things necessary for the occasion.\\nThe preparations lasted ten days, after which he set out with the\\nSultan, whose heart burned in yearning for his city whence he had\\nbeen absent a whole twelvemonth. They journeyed with an escort of\\nMamelukes[FN#137] carrying all manners of precious gifts and\\nrarities, nor stinted they wayfaring day and night for a full\\nyear until they approached the Sultan\\'s capital, and sent on\\nmessengers to announce their coming. Then the Wazir and the whole\\narmy came out to meet him in joy and gladness, for they had given\\nup all hope of ever seeing their King; and the troops kissed the\\nground before him and wished him joy of his safety. He entered\\nand took seat upon his throne and the Minister came before him\\nand, when acquainted with all that had be fallen the young\\nPrince, he congratulated him on his narrow escape. When order was\\nrestored throughout the land the King gave largesse to many of\\nhis people, and said to the Wazir, \"Hither the Fisherman who\\nbrought us the fishes!\" So he sent for the man who had been the\\nfirst cause of the city and the citizens being delivered from\\nenchantment and, when he came in to the presence, the Sultan\\nbestowed upon him a dress of honour, and questioned him of his\\ncondition and whether he had children. The Fisherman gave him to\\nknow that he had two daughters and a son, so the King sent for\\nthem and, taking one daughter to wife, gave the other to the\\nyoung Prince and made the son his head treasurer. Furthermore he\\ninvested his Wazir with the Sultanate of the City in the Black\\nIslands whilome belonging to the young Prince, and dispatched\\nwith him the escort of fifty armed slaves together with dresses\\nof honour for all the Emirs and Grandees. The Wazir kissed hands\\nand fared forth on his way; while the Sultan and the Prince abode\\nat home in all the solace and the delight of life; and the\\n\\n\\x0cFisherman became the richest man of his age, and his daughters\\nwived with Kings, until death came to them. And yet, O King!\\nthis is not more wondrous than the story of\\n\\nThe Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad.\\nOnce upon a time there was a Porter in Baghdad, who was a\\nbachelor and who would remain unmarried. It came to pass on a\\ncertain day, as he stood about the street leaning idly upon his\\ncrate, behold, there stood before him an honourable woman in a\\nmantilla of Mosul[FN#138] silk, broidered with gold and bordered\\nwith brocade; her walking shoes were also purfled with gold and\\nher hair floated in long plaits. She raised her face veil[FN#139]\\nand, showing two black eyes fringed with jetty lashes, whose\\nglances were soft and languishing and whose perfect beauty was\\never blandishing, she accosted the Porter and said in the suavest\\ntones and choicest language, \"Take up thy crate and follow me.\"\\nThe Porter was so dazzled he could hardly believe that he heard\\nher aright, but he shouldered his basket in hot haste saying in\\nhimself, \"O day of good luck! O day of Allah\\'s grace!\" and walked\\nafter her till she stopped at the door of a house. There she\\nrapped, and presently came out to her an old man, a Nazarene, to\\nwhom she gave a gold piece, receiving from him in return what she\\nrequired of strained wine clear as olive oil; and she set it\\nsafely in the hamper, saying \"Lift and follow.\" Quoth the Porter,\\n\"This, by Allah, is indeed an auspicious day, a day propitious\\nfor the granting of all a man wisheth.\" He again hoisted up the\\ncrate and followed her; till she stopped at a fruiterer\\'s shop\\nand bought from him Shami[FN#140] apples and Osmani quinces and\\nOmani[FN#141] peaches, and cucumbers of Nile growth, and Egyptian\\nlimes and Sultani oranges and citrons; besides Aleppine jasmine,\\nscented myrtle berries, Damascene nenuphars, flower of\\nprivet[FN#142] and camomile, blood red anemones, violets, and\\npomegranate bloom, eglantine and narcissus, and set the whole in\\nthe Porter\\'s crate, saying, \"Up with it.\" So he lifted and\\nfollowed her till she stopped at a butcher\\'s booth and said, \"Cut\\nme off ten pounds of mutton.\" She paid him his price and he\\nwrapped it in a banana leaf, whereupon she laid it in the crate\\nand said \"Hoist, O Porter.\" He hoisted accordingly, and followed\\nher as she walked on till she stopped at a grocer\\'s, where she\\nbought dry fruits and pistachio kernels, Tihamah raisins, shelled\\nalmonds and all wanted for dessert, and said to the Porter, \"Lift\\nand follow me.\" So he up with his hamper and after her till she\\nstayed at the confectioner\\'s, and she bought an earthen platter,\\nand piled it with all kinds of sweetmeats in his shop, open\\nworked tarts and fritters scented with musk and \"soap cakes,\" and\\nlemon loaves and melon preserves,[FN#143] and \"Zaynab\\'s combs,\"\\nand \"ladies\\' fingers,\" and \"Kazi\\'s tit-bits\" and goodies of every\\ndescription; and placed the platter in the Porter\\'s crate.\\nThereupon quoth he (being a merry man), \"Thou shouldest have told\\nme, and I would have brought with me a pony or a she camel to\\ncarry all this market stuff.\" She smiled and gave him a little\\ncuff on the nape saying, \"Step out and exceed not in words for\\n(Allah willing!) thy wage will not be wanting.\" Then she stopped\\nat a perfumer\\'s and took from him ten sorts of waters, rose\\nscented with musk, grange Lower, waterlily, willow flower, violet\\nand five others; and she also bought two loaves of sugar, a\\nbottle for perfume spraying, a lump of male in cense, aloe wood,\\nambergris and musk, with candles of Alex\\' andria wax; and she put\\n\\n\\x0cthe whole into the basket, saying, \"Up with thy crate and after\\nme.\" He did so and followed until she stood before the\\ngreengrocer\\'s, of whom she bought pickled safflower and olives,\\nin brine and in oil; with tarragon and cream cheese and hard\\nSyrian cheese; and she stowed them away in the crate saying to\\nthe Porter, \"Take up thy basket and follow me.\" He did so and\\nwent after her till she came to a fair mansion fronted by a\\nspacious court, a tall, fine place to which columns gave strength\\nand grace: and the gate thereof had two leaves of ebony inlaid\\nwith plates of red gold. The lady stopped at the door and,\\nturning her face veil sideways, knocked softly with her knuckles\\nwhilst the Porter stood behind her, thinking of naught save her\\nbeauty and loveliness. Presently the door swung back and both\\nleaves were opened, whereupon he looked to see who had opened it;\\nand behold, it was a lady of tall figure, some five feet high; a\\nmodel of beauty and loveliness, brilliance and symmetry and\\nperfect grace. Her forehead was flower white; her cheeks like the\\nanemone ruddy bright; her eyes were those of the wild heifer or\\nthe gazelle, with eyebrows like the crescent moon which ends\\nSha\\'aban and begins Ramazan;[FN#144] her mouth was the ring of\\nSulayman,[FN#145] her lips coral red, and her teeth like a line\\nof strung pearls or of camomile petals. Her throat recalled the\\nantelope\\'s, and her breasts, like two pomegranates of even size,\\nstood at bay as it were,[FN#146] her body rose and fell in waves\\nbelow her dress like the rolls of a piece of brocade, and her\\nnavel[FN#147] would hold an ounce of benzoin ointment. In fine\\nshe was like her of whom the poet said:-On Sun and Moon of palace cast thy sight * Enjoy her flower like\\nface, her fragrant light:\\nThine eyes shall never see in hair so black * Beauty encase a\\nbrow so purely white:\\nThe ruddy rosy cheek proclaims her claim * Though fail her name\\nwhose beauties we indite:\\nAs sways her gait I smile at hips so big * And weep to see the\\nwaist they bear so slight.\\nWhen the Porter looked upon her his wits were waylaid, and his\\nsenses were stormed so that his crate went nigh to fall from his\\nhead, and he said to himself, \"Never have I in my life seen a day\\nmore blessed than this day!\" Then quoth the lady portress to the\\nlady cateress, \"Come in from the gate and relieve this poor man\\nof his load.\" So the provisioner went in followed by the portress\\nand the Porter and went on till they reached a spacious ground\\nfloor hall,[FN#148] built with admirable skill and beautified\\nwith all manner colours and carvings; with upper balconies and\\ngroined arches and galleries and cupboards and recesses whose\\ncurtains hung before them. In the midst stood a great basin full\\nof water surrounding a fine fountain, and at the upper end on the\\nraised dais was a couch of juniper wood set with gems and pearls,\\nwith a canopy like mosquito curtains of red satin silk looped up\\nwith pearls as big as filberts and bigger. Thereupon sat a lady\\nbright of blee, with brow beaming brilliancy, the dream of\\nphilosophy, whose eyes were fraught with Babel\\'s gramarye[FN#149]\\nand her eye brows were arched as for archery; her breath breathed\\nambergris and perfumery and her lips were sugar to taste and\\ncarnelian to see. Her stature was straight as the letter\\nI[FN#150] and her face shamed the noon sun\\'s radiancy; and she\\nwas even as a galaxy, or a dome with golden marquetry or a bride\\ndisplayed in choicest finery or a noble maid of Araby.[FN#151]\\nRight well of her sang the bard when he said:-Her smiles twin rows of pearls display * Chamomile-buds or rimey\\nspray\\n\\n\\x0cHer tresses stray as night let down * And shames her light the\\ndawn o\\' day.\\n[FN#152]The third lady rising from the couch stepped forward with\\ngrace ful swaying gait till she reached the middle of the saloon,\\nwhen she said to her sisters, \"Why stand ye here? take it down\\nfrom this poor man\\'s head!\" Then the cateress went and stood\\nbefore him, and the portress behind him while the third helped\\nthem, and they lifted the load from the Porter\\'s head; and,\\nemptying it of all that was therein, set everything in its place.\\nLastly they gave him two gold pieces, saying, \"Wend thy ways, O\\nPorter.\" But he went not, for he stood looking at the ladies and\\nadmiring what uncommon beauty was theirs, and their pleasant\\nmanners and kindly dispositions (never had he seen goodlier); and\\nhe gazed wistfully at that good store of wines and sweet scented\\nflowers and fruits and other matters. Also he marvelled with\\nexceeding marvel, especially to see no man in the place and\\ndelayed his going; whereupon quoth the eldest lady, \"What aileth\\nthee that goest not; haply thy wage be too little?\" And, turning\\nto her sister the cateress, she said, \"Give him another diner!\"\\nBut the Porter answered, \"By Allah, my lady, it is not for the\\nwage; my hire is never more than two dirhams; but in very sooth\\nmy heart and my soul are taken up with you and your condition. I\\nwonder to see you single with ne\\'er a man about you and not a\\nsoul to bear you company; and well you wot that the minaret\\ntoppleth o\\'er unless it stand upon four, and you want this same\\nfourth; and women\\'s pleasure without man is short of measure,\\neven as the poet said:-Seest not we want for joy four things all told * The harp and\\nlute, the flute and flageolet;']"

      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that after the sorceress had taken water from the pool and spoken some unintelligible words over it, the fish danced, lifted their heads and immediately rose up, as the magic spell was removed from the city. It became inhabited again, the merchants buying and selling and each man practising his craft, while the islands were restored to their former state. The sorceress went straight away to the tomb and said to the king: ‘Give me your noble hand, my darling, and get up.’ In a low voice, the king replied: ‘Come to me.’ When she did this he, with the drawn sword in his hand, struck her in the breast as she clung on to him, so that it emerged gleaming from her back. With another blow he cut her in two, and threw the two halves on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came out he found the young man whom she had enchanted standing waiting for him, congratulating him on his escape, kissing his hand and thanking him. The king asked him whether he would prefer to stay in his own city, or to go with him to his. ‘King of the age,’ said the young man, ‘do you know how long a journey it is to your city?’ ‘Two and a half days,’ replied the king. ‘If you have been sleeping,’ said the young man, ‘wake up. Between you and your city is a full year’s worth of hard travelling. You only got here in two and a half days because this place was under a spell. But I shall not part from you for the blink of an eye.’ The king was glad and said: ‘Praise be to God, Who has given you to me. You shall be my son, for all my life I have been granted no other.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They embraced with great joy and then walked to the palace. Here the young man told his courtiers to make ready for a journey and to collect supplies and whatever was needed. This took ten days, after which the young man and the king set off, the latter being in a fever of anxiety to get back his own city. They travelled with fifty mamluks and magnificent gifts, and their journey continued day and night for a whole year until, as God had decreed their safety, they eventually reached their goal. Word was sent to the vizier that the king had arrived safe and sound, and he, together with his soldiers, who had despaired of him, came to greet him, kissing the ground before him and congratulating him on his safe arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king then entered the city to take his seat on his throne, and the vizier, on presenting himself and hearing of all that had happened to the young man, added his own congratulations. Then, when things were settled, the king presented gifts to many people and he told the vizier to fetch the man who had brought him the fish and who had been responsible for saving the people of the enchanted city. A messenger was sent to him and when he was brought to the palace, the king presented him with robes of honour and asked him about his circumstances, and whether he had any children. The fisherman replied that he had two daughters and one son. The king sent for them and married one of the girls himself, giving the other to the young man. The fisherman’s son was made treasurer, while the vizier was invested and sent off as ruler of the capital of the Black Islands, the young man’s city. With him were sent the fifty mamluks who had come with the king, and he was given robes of honour to take to the emirs of the city. He kissed the king’s hands and started out immediately, while the king remained with the young man. The fisherman, meanwhile, had become the richest man of his age, while his daughters remained as wives of kings until they died.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, however, is not more remarkable than what happened to the porter. There was an unmarried porter who lived in the city of Baghdad. One day, while he was standing in the market, leaning on his basket, a woman came up to him wrapped in a silken Mosuli shawl with a floating ribbon and wearing embroidered shoes fringed with gold thread. When she raised her veil, beneath it could be seen dark eyes which, with their eyelashes and eyelids, shot soft glances, perfect in their quality. She turned to the porter and said in a sweet, clear voice: ‘Take your basket and follow me.’ Almost before he was sure of what she had said, he rushed to pick up the basket. ‘What a lucky day, a day of good fortune!’ he exclaimed, following her until she stopped by the door of a house. She knocked at it and a Christian came down to whom she gave a dinar, taking in exchange an olive-coloured jar of strained wine. She put this in the basket and said to the porter: ‘Pick this up and follow me.’ ‘By God,’ repeated the porter, ‘this is a blessed and a fortunate day!’ and he did what she told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then stopped at a fruiterer’s shop, where she bought Syrian apples, Uthmani quinces, Omani peaches, jasmine and water lilies from Syria, autumn cucumbers, lemons, sultani oranges, scented myrtle, privet flowers, camomile blossoms, red anemones, violets, pomegranate blooms and eglantine. All these she put into the porter’s basket, telling him to pick it up. This he did and he followed her until she stopped at the butcher’s, where she got the man to cut her ten ratls’ weight of meat. He did this, and after paying him, she wrapped the meat in banana leaves and put it in the basket, giving the porter his instructions. He picked up the basket and followed her to the grocer, from whom she bought pistachio kernels for making a dessert, Tihama raisins and shelled almonds. The porter was told to pick them up and to follow her. Next she stopped at the sweetmeat seller’s shop. This time she bought a bowl and filled it with all that he had – sugar cakes, doughnuts stuffed with musk, ‘soap’ cakes, lemon tarts, Maimuni tarts, ‘Zainab’s combs’, sugar fingers and ‘qadis’ snacks’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every type of pastry was piled on to a plate and put into the basket, at which the porter exclaimed: ‘If you had told me, I’d have brought a donkey with me to carry all this stuff.’ The girl smiled and gave him a cuff on the back of the neck. ‘Hurry up,’ she said. ‘Don’t talk so much and you will get your reward, if God Almighty wills it.’ Then she stopped at the perfume seller’s where she bought ten types of scented water – including rosewater, orange-flower water, waters scented with water lilies and with willow flowers – two sugar loaves, a bottle of musk-scented rosewater, a quantity of frankincense, aloes, ambergris, musk and Alexandrian candles. All of these she put in the basket, telling the porter to pick it up and follow her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He carried his basket and followed her to a handsome house, overlooking a spacious courtyard. It was a tall, pillared building, whose door had two ebony leaves, plated with red gold. The girl halted by the door, raised the veil from her face and knocked lightly, while the porter remained standing behind her, his thoughts occupied with her beauty. The door opened and, as its leaves parted, the porter looked at the person who had opened it. He saw a lady of medium height, with jutting breasts, beautiful, comely, resplendent, with a perfect and well-proportioned figure, a radiant brow, red cheeks and eyes rivalling those of a wild cow or a gazelle. Her eyebrows were like the crescent moon of the month of Sha‘ban; she had cheeks like red anemones, a mouth like the seal of Solomon, coral red lips, teeth like camomile blossoms or pearls on a string, and a gazelle-like neck. Her bosom was like an ornate fountain, with breasts like twin pomegranates; she had an elegant belly and a navel that could contain an ounce of unguent. She was as the poet described:\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the sun and the moon of the palaces,\n",
      "\n",
      "At the jewel in her nose and at her flowery splendour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your eye has not seen white on black\n",
      "\n",
      "United in beauty as in her face and in her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is rosy-cheeked; beauty proclaims her name,\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you are not fortunate enough to know of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She swayed and I laughed in wonder at her haunches,\n",
      "\n",
      "But her waist prompted my tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the porter stared at her, he lost his wits and the basket almost fell from his head. ‘Never in my life,’ he repeated, ‘have I known a more blessed day than this!’ The girl who had answered the door said to the other, who had brought the provisions: ‘Come in and take the basket from this poor porter.’ So the two girls went in, followed by the porter, and they went on until they reached a spacious, well-designed and beautiful courtyard, with additional carvings, vaulted chambers and alcoves, and furnished with sofas, wardrobes, cupboards and curtains. In the middle of it was a large pool filled with water on which floated a skiff, and at its upper end was a couch of juniper wood studded with gems over which was suspended a mosquito net of red satin, the buttons of whose fastenings were pearls as big as or bigger than hazelnuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "From within this emerged a resplendent girl of pleasing beauty, glorious as the moon, with the character of a philosopher. Her eyes were bewitching, with eyebrows like bent bows; her figure was slender and straight as the letter alif; her breath had the scent of ambergris; her lips were carnelian red, sweet as sugar; and her face would shame the light of the radiant sun. She was like one of the stars of heaven, a golden dome, an unveiled bride or a noble Bedouin lady, as described by the poet:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is as though she smiles to show stringed pearls,\n",
      "\n",
      "Hailstones or flowers of camomile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The locks of her hair hang black as night,\n",
      "\n",
      "While her beauty shames the light of dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This third girl rose from the couch and walked slowly to join her sisters in the centre of the hall. ‘Why are you standing here?’ she said. ‘Take the basket from the head of this poor porter.’ The provision buyer or housekeeper came first, followed by the doorkeeper, and the third girl helped them to lower the basket, after which they emptied out its contents and put everything in its place. Then they gave the porter two dinars and told him to be off. For his part, he looked at the lovely girls, the most beautiful he had ever seen, with their equally delightful natures. There were no men with them and, as he stared in astonishment at the wine, the fruits, the scented blossoms and all the rest, he was reluctant to leave. ‘Why don’t you go?’ asked the girl. ‘Do you think that we didn’t pay you enough?’ and with that, she turned to her sister and said: ‘Give him another dinar.’ ‘By God, lady,’ said the porter, ‘it was not that I thought that the payment was too little, for my fee would not come to two dirhams, but you have taken over my heart and soul. How is it that you are alone with no men here and no pleasant companion? You know that there must be four to share a proper feast and women cannot enjoy themselves except with men. As the poet says:\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you not see that four things join for entertainment –\n",
      "\n",
      "Harp, lute, zither and pipe,\n",
      "\n",
      "Matched by four scented flowers –\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose, myrtle, gillyflower, anemone.\n",
      "\n",
      "These only become pleasant with another four –\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine, gardens, a beloved and some gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three of you and so you need a fourth, who must be a man of intelligence, sensible, clever and one who can keep a secret.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The three girls were surprised by what the porter said, and they laughed at him and asked: ‘Who can produce us a man like that? We are girls and are afraid of entrusting our secrets to someone who would not keep them. We have read in an account what the poet Ibn al-Thumam once said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Guard your secret as you can, entrusting it to none,\n",
      "\n",
      "For if you do, you will have let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your own breast cannot contain your secret,\n",
      "\n",
      "How is it to be held by someone else?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Abu Nuwas has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever lets the people know his secret\n",
      "\n",
      "Deserves a brand imprinted on his forehead.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the porter heard what they said, he exclaimed: ‘By God, I am an intelligent and a trustworthy man; I have read books and studied histories; I make public what is good and conceal what is bad. As the poet says:\n",
      "\n",
      "Only the trustworthy can keep a secret,\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is with the good that secrets are concealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "With me they are kept locked inside a room\n",
      "\n",
      "Whose keys are lost and whose door has been sealed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girls heard this quotation, they said: ‘You know that we have spent a great deal of money on this place. Do you have anything with you which you can use to pay us back? We shall not let you sit with us as our companion and to look on our comely and beautiful faces until you pay down some money. Have you not heard what the author of the proverb said: “Love without cash is worthless”?’ The doorkeeper said: ‘My dear, if you have something, you are someone, but if you have nothing, then go without anything.’ At that point, however, the housekeeper said: ‘Sisters, let him be. For, by God, he has not failed us today, whereas someone else might not have put up with us, and whatever debt he may run up, I will settle for him.’ The porter was delighted and thanked her, kissing the ground, but the girl who had been on the couch said: ‘By God, we shall only let you sit with us on one condition, which is that you ask no questions about what does not concern you, and if you are inquisitive you will be beaten.’ ‘I agree, lady,’ said the porter. ‘I swear by my head and my eye, and here I am, a man with no tongue.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper then got up, tucked up her skirts, set out the wine bottles and strained the wine. She set green herbs beside the wine-jar and brought everything that might be needed. She then brought out the wine-jar and sat down with her two sisters, while the porter, sitting between the three of them, thought he must be dreaming. From the wine-jar that she had fetched she filled a cup, drank it, and followed it with a second and a third. Then she filled the cup and passed it to her sister and finally to the porter. She recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink with pleasure and the enjoyment of good health,\n",
      "\n",
      "For this wine is a cure for all disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The porter took the cup in his hand, bowed, thanked her and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine should be drunk beside a trusted friend,\n",
      "\n",
      "One of pure birth from the line of old heroes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For wine is like the wind, sweet if it passes scented flowers,\n",
      "\n",
      "But stinking if it blows over a corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "Take wine only from a fawn,\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtle in meaning when she speaks to you,\n",
      "\n",
      "Resembling the wine itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had recited these lines, he kissed the hand of each of the girls. Then he drank until he became tipsy, after which he swayed and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "The only blood we are allowed to drink\n",
      "\n",
      "Is blood that comes from grapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So pour this out for me, and may my life\n",
      "\n",
      "And all I have, both new and old,\n",
      "\n",
      "Serve to ransom your gazelle-like eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the housekeeper took the cup, filled it and gave it to the doorkeeper, who took it from him with thanks and drank it. She then filled it for the lady of the house, before pouring another cup and passing it to the porter, who kissed the ground in front of her, thanked her and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fetch wine, by God; bring me the brimming glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour it for me; this is the water of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went up to the mistress of the house and said: ‘Lady, I am your slave, your mamluk and your servant.’ He recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "By the door there stands a slave of yours,\n",
      "\n",
      "Acknowledging your kindly charity.\n",
      "\n",
      "May he come in, fair one, to see your loveliness?\n",
      "\n",
      "I swear by love itself I cannot leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied: ‘Enjoy yourself, drink with pleasure and the well-being that follows the path of health.’ He took the cup, kissed her hand and chanted:\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave her old wine, coloured like her cheeks,\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmixed and gleaming like a fiery brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "She kissed it and said, laughingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How can you pour us people’s cheeks?’\n",
      "\n",
      "I said: ‘Drink: this comes from my tears;\n",
      "\n",
      "Its redness is my blood;\n",
      "\n",
      "My breath has heated it within the glass.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied with the line:\n",
      "\n",
      "Companion, if you have wept blood for me,\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour it obediently for me to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She then took the cup, drank it and sat down with her sister. They continued to drink, with the porter seated between them, and as they drank, they danced, laughed and sang, reciting poems and lyrics. The porter began to play with them, kissing, biting, rubbing, feeling, touching and taking liberties. One of them would give him morsels to eat, another would cuff him and slap him, and the third would bring him scented flowers. With them he was enjoying the pleasantest of times, as though he was seated among the houris of Paradise.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went on in this way until the wine had taken its effect on their heads and their brains. When it had got the upper hand of them, the doorkeeper stood up, stripped off her clothes until she was naked, and letting down her hair as a veil, she jumped into the pool. She sported in the water, ducking her head and then spitting out the water, after which she took some in her mouth and spat it over the porter. She washed her limbs and between her thighs, after which she came out from the water and threw herself down on his lap. ‘My master, my darling, what is the name of this?’ she said, pointing to her vagina. ‘Your womb,’ he replied. ‘Oh!’ she said. ‘Have you no shame?’ and she seized him by the neck and started to cuff him. ‘Your vagina,’ he said, and she cuffed him again on the back of his neck, saying: ‘Oh! Oh! How disgusting! Aren’t you ashamed?’ ‘Your vulva,’ he replied. ‘Do you feel no shame for your honour?’ and she struck him a blow with her hand. ‘Your hornet,’ he said, at which the lady of the house pounced on him and beat him, saying: ‘Don’t speak like that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "With every new name that he produced, the girls beat him more and more, until the back of his neck had almost dissolved under their slaps. They were laughing among themselves, until he asked: ‘What do you call it, then?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ replied the doorkeeper. ‘Thank God, I am safe now,’ said the porter. ‘Good for you, mint of the dykes.’ Then the wine was passed round again, and the housekeeper got up, took off her clothes and threw herself on to the porter’s lap. ‘What is this called, light of my eyes?’ she asked, pointing at her private parts. ‘Your vagina,’ he said. ‘Oh, how dirty of you!’ she exclaimed, and she struck him a blow that resounded around the hall, adding: ‘Oh! Oh! Have you no shame?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he said, but blows and slaps still rained on the back of his neck. He tried another four names, but the girls kept on saying: ‘No, no!’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he repeated, and they laughed so much that they fell over backwards. Then they fell to beating his neck, saying: ‘No, that’s not its name.’ He said: ‘O my sisters, what is it called?’ ‘Husked sesame,’ they said. Then the housekeeper put her clothes back on and they sat, drinking together, with the porter groaning at the pain in his neck and shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the wine had been passed round again, the lady of the house, the most beautiful of the three, stood up and stripped off her clothes. The porter grasped the back of his neck with his hand and massaged it, saying: ‘My neck and my shoulders are common property.’ When the girl was naked, she jumped into the pool, dived under water, played around and washed herself. To the porter in her nakedness she looked like a sliver of the moon, with a face like the full moon when it rises or the dawn when it breaks. He looked at her figure, her breasts and her heavy buttocks as they swayed, while she was naked as her Lord had created her. ‘Oh! Oh!’ he said, and he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I compare your figure to a sappy branch,\n",
      "\n",
      "I load my heart with wrongs and with injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Branches are most beautiful when concealed with leaves,\n",
      "\n",
      "While you are loveliest when we meet you naked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing these lines, the girl came out of the pool and sat on the porter’s lap. She pointed at her vulva and said: ‘Little master, what is the name of this?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he replied, and when she exclaimed in disgust, he tried ‘the husked sesame’. ‘Bah!’ she said. ‘Your womb,’ he suggested. ‘Oh! Oh! Aren’t you ashamed?’ and she slapped the back of his neck. Whatever name he produced, she slapped him, saying: ‘No, no,’ until he asked: ‘Sisters, what is it called?’ ‘The khan of Abu Mansur,’ they replied. ‘Praise God that I have reached safety at last,’ he said. ‘Ho for the khan of Abu Mansur!’ The girl got up and put on her clothes and they all went back to what they had been doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a time the wine circulated among them and the porter then got up, undressed and went into the pool. The girls looked at him swimming in the water and washing under his beard and beneath his armpits, as they had done. Then he came out and threw himself into the lap of the lady of the house, with his arms in the lap of the doorkeeper and his feet and legs in the lap of the girl who had bought the provisions. Then he pointed to his penis and said: ‘Ladies, what is the name of this?’ They all laughed at this until they fell over backwards. ‘Your zubb,’ one of them suggested. ‘No,’ he said, and he bit each of them. ‘Your air,’ they said, but he repeated ‘No’, and embraced each of them.\n",

      "When I knew for certain that I had killed him, I got up, climbed the stairs and replaced the soil. Then I looked out to sea and caught sight of the ship making for the shore. I said fearfully: ‘Now they will come and find the boy dead. They will know that it was I who killed him and they will be bound to kill me.’ I made for a high tree, which I climbed, concealing myself among the leaves, and scarcely had I settled there than the black slaves and the youth’s old father disembarked and went towards the hidden chamber. They cleared away the earth, found the trap-door and went down. There they found the youth apparently asleep, his face glowing with the effect of his bath, dressed in clean clothes but with the knife plunged into his breast. They shrieked, wept, struck their faces, wailing and lamenting. The old man fainted for so long that the slaves thought that he would not survive his son. They wrapped the corpse of the youth in his clothes, covered him in a silken sheet and returned to the boat. Behind them came the old man, but when he saw his son laid out, he fell to the ground, poured earth on his head, struck his face and plucked out his beard, while the thought that his son had been killed caused his tears to flow faster and he fainted again. One of the slaves got up and spread a piece of silk on a couch, upon which they laid the old man and then sat by his head.\n",

Then they put his body on the ship beside that of his son and, unfurling the sail, they passed out of sight. I came down from the tree, went through the trapdoor and thought about the youth.

In this way a month went by and, as I looked out over the western tip of the island, I could see that with every day that passed the water was drying up. Eventually there was very little of it left to the west and there was no longer any current. By the end of the month, to my joy, the sea had dried up in that direction and, sure that I was now safe, I got up and waded through what water was left until I reached the mainland. There I encountered sand dunes in which camels would sink up to their hocks, but, steeling myself, I managed to cross them, and then far off I caught a glimpse of a fire burning brightly. I made for it, hoping to find relief. Meanwhile I recited:\n",

      "When my course brought me nearer, I saw a palace with a door of brass which, when the sun shone on it, gleamed from a distance like fire. I was delighted at the sight and sat down opposite the door. Scarcely had I taken my seat when there came towards me ten young men, wearing splendid clothes, with a very old companion. All the young men had lost their right eyes, and I was astonished by their appearance and at this coincidence. When they saw me they greeted me and asked me about myself and about my story. They were amazed when I told them what had happened to me and of my misfortunes, and they then brought me into the palace. Ranged around the hall were ten couches, each spread with and covered in blue material. In the middle of these was a small couch whose coverings, like those of the others, was also blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we entered the room, each of the young men went to his own couch and the old man went to the small one in the middle. He told me to sit down, but warned me not to ask questions about him and his companions or why they were one-eyed. He then brought food for each man in one container and drink in another and he did the same for me. After that, they sat asking me about my circumstances and my adventures, and their questions and my replies took up most of the night. Then they said: ‘Shaikh, bring us our due.’ ‘Willingly,’ the old man replied, and after going away into a closet, he came back carrying on his head ten trays, each with a covering of blue, and gave one to each of the young men. Then he lit ten candles, fixing one to each tray, and removed the covers. There beneath the covers on the trays was nothing but ashes and grime from cooking pots. All the young men rolled up their sleeves and, with tears and sobs, they smeared and slapped their faces, tore their clothes and beat their breasts, saying: ‘We were seated at our ease but our inquisitiveness did not leave us.’ They went on doing this until it was nearly morning, when the old man got up and heated water for them with which they washed their faces before putting on fresh clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I saw this, I said: ‘I am astonished, amazed and afire with curiosity.’ I forgot what had happened to me and, unable to keep silent, I asked them: ‘Why have you done this, after we had become pleasantly tired? You are men of sound minds – praise be to God – and it is only madmen who act like this. I implore you by what you hold dearest to tell me your story and why you have lost your eyes and why you smear your faces with ashes and grime.’ They turned to me and said: ‘Young man, do not be led astray by your youth and do not press your question.’ Then they got up and so did I, after which the old man brought out food, and when we had eaten and the plates had been removed, they sat talking until nightfall. The old man then rose and lit candles and lamps, before bringing us food and drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat talking in a friendly way to one another until midnight. ‘Bring us our due,’ they then told the old man, ‘as it is time for sleep.’ He brought the trays with the black ashes and they did what they had done on the first night. The same thing went on for a whole month while I stayed with them, as every night they would smear their faces with ashes before washing them and then changing their clothes. I was astonished at this and became more and more uneasy, to the extent that I could neither eat nor drink. ‘Young men,’ I said, ‘you must satisfy my concern and tell me why it is that you smear your faces.’ They said: ‘It is better to keep our secret hidden,’ but as I was too perplexed to eat or drink, I insisted that they tell me. ‘This will go hard with you,’ they replied, ‘as you will become like us.’ ‘There is no help for it,’ I said, ‘unless you allow me to leave you and go back to my family, so that I may no longer have to watch all this. As the proverb has it, it is better for me to be far away from you, for what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve over.’ At this, they took a ram, slaughtered it and skinned it, then told me to take a knife, wrap the skin around me and sew it up. They went on: ‘A bird called a rukh will swoop on you and lift you up, before setting you down on a mountain, where you should slit open the skin and come out. The bird will be scared away from you and will go off, leaving you alone. Walk on for half a day and you will find in front of you a strange-looking palace. Enter it and you will have achieved what you wanted, as it was because we went into it that we blacken our faces and each of us has lost an eye. It would take a long time to explain all this, as each of us has a tale to tell of how his right eye was plucked out.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pleased when I heard this, and after I had done what they had instructed, the bird came and carried me off, leaving me on the mountain top. I got out of the skin and walked on until I reached the palace, where I found forty girls, beautiful as moons, at whom no one could tire of looking. On seeing me, they all greeted me warmly. ‘We have been expecting you for a month,’ they said, ‘and praise be to God Who has brought us one who deserves us and whom we deserve.’ They seated me on a high dais and said: ‘Today you are our lord and master and we are your slave girls, under your command, so give us your orders.’ I was astonished by all this, but they brought me food and we ate together, after which they fetched drink. They clustered around me and five of them spread out a mat around which they set out quantities of scented flowers, together with fruits, fresh and dried. Then they brought wine and we sat down to drink as they sang to the music of the lute.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine circulated and such was my delight that I forgot all worldly cares. ‘This is the life,’ I said, and I stayed with them until it was time to sleep. ‘Take whichever of us you choose to sleep with you,’ they said. So I took one of them, with a beautiful face, dark eyes, black hair, well-spaced teeth, perfect in all aspects, with joining eyebrows, like a supple bough or a sprig of sweet basil, astonishing and amazing the mind. As the poet has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "It shows ignorance to compare her to a tender branch,\n",
      "\n",
      "And how far is she unlike a gazelle!\n",
      "\n",
      "How can the dear gazelle have a form like hers\n",
      "\n",
      "Or honeyed lips like hers – how sweet a drink –\n",
      "\n",
      "Or her wide eyes, that act as murderers,\n",
      "\n",
      "Capturing the desperate lover, tortured and then slain?\n",
      "\n",
      "I yearn for her; mine is a heathen love;\n",
      "\n",
      "No wonder that the lovesick is in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I recited to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "My eyes see nothing but your loveliness;\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from you no thought enters my heart,\n",
      "\n",
      "For every thought of mine is fixed on you;\n",
      "\n",
      "In your love is my death and my rebirth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I then got up and spent a night of unsurpassed pleasure sleeping with her. In the morning, the girls took me to the baths, washed me and gave me the most splendid of clothes to wear. Then they brought out food and drink and we ate and drank, the wine circulating until nightfall. This time I chose another lovely, pliant girl. As the poet describes:\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw upon her breast two caskets sealed with musk,\n",
      "\n",
      "Withheld from any lover’s grasp,\n",
      "\n",
      "Guarded with arrows she shoots from her eyes –\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrows that strike down any who attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I passed the most delightful of nights, sleeping with her until dawn. In short, my lady, I spent a whole year with these girls, enjoying a carefree life, but as the next year began, they said: ‘Would that we had never known you, but if you listen to us you can save yourself.’ They then started to weep and when I asked them what the matter was, they explained: ‘We are the daughters of kings, and we have been gathered together here for a period of years. We go away for forty days and then stay here for a year, eating, drinking, enjoying ourselves and taking our pleasure, after which we go off again. This is our custom and we are afraid that when we leave you, you will not do what we tell you. Here are the keys of the palace, which we are handing over to you. In the palace are forty rooms, thirty-nine of which you may enter, but you must take care not to open the door of the fortieth, or else you will be forced to leave us.’ ‘If that is so,’ I said, ‘then I shall certainly not open it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "One of them then came to me, embraced me, wept and recited the lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "If after separation we come close again,\n",
      "\n",
      "The frown upon Time’s face will turn into a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a sight of you serves as kohl for my eyes,\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall forgive Time all its evil deeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "When she came close to say farewell, she and her heart\n",
      "\n",
      "Were allies there to longing and to love.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wept moist pearls, while my tears, as they flowed,\n",
      "\n",
      "Were like carnelians, forming a necklace on her breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On seeing the girls’ tears, I swore that I would never open the forbidden room, and after I had said goodbye, they went outside and flew away. So I sat in the palace by myself and when evening approached, I opened the door to the first chamber and went in. There I found a virtual paradise, a garden with green trees, ripe fruits, tuneful birds and gushing waters. I felt at rest as I walked among the trees, smelling sweet-scented flowers and listening to the song of the birds as they glorified the One God, the Omnipotent. I looked at apples whose colour was midway between red and yellow, as the poet has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "An apple’s nature has combined two shades –\n",
      "\n",
      "The beloved’s cheek and the complexion of the timorous lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I looked at quinces that put to shame the scent of musk and ambergris, as the poet has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the quince are all mankind’s delights;\n",
      "\n",
      "Its fame surpasses every other fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its taste is wine and its scent diffused musk,\n",
      "\n",
      "Golden in colour, shaped like the full moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I then looked at apricots whose beauty delighted the eye like polished rubies, and after that I left the chamber and locked the door again. Next day I opened the door to the second chamber, went in and found a large space, with date palms and a flowing stream whose banks were carpeted with rose bushes, jasmine, marjoram, eglantine, narcissus and gillyflowers. Breezes passed over these scented flowers and the scent spread in all directions, filling me with perfect happiness. I left this chamber, locked the door behind me and opened the third. Here I found a hall, paved with coloured marble, valuable minerals and precious stones. In it were cages of sandalwood and aloes wood, with singing birds, such as the nightingale, the ringdove, blackbirds, turtledoves and the Nubian song thrush. I was delighted by this; my cares were dispelled and I slept there until morning. Then I opened the fourth door to discover a large chamber with forty closets whose doors were standing open. I went in and saw an indescribable quantity of pearls, sapphires, topazes, emeralds and other precious stones. In my astonishment I exclaimed: ‘I do not think that there is a single king who has all this in his treasury.’ Joy filled me, my cares leaving me, and I said: ‘I am the supreme ruler of the age; my wealth is a gift granted me by God’s grace; the forty girls are under my authority, and they have no other man besides me.’ I went from place to place until thirty-nine days had passed, during which time I had opened all the rooms except for the one whose door I had been told not to open.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one, which made the number up to forty, preoccupied me and, in order to bring me misery, Satan incited me to open it. I could not hold out against this, and so with only one day left before the girls were due to return, I went to the chamber, opened the door and went in. I found a fragrance the like of which I had never smelt before. It overcame my senses and I fell down in a faint, which lasted for an hour. Then I plucked up my courage and went further into the room, whose floor I found spread with saffron. Light was given by lamps of gold and candles from which was diffused the scent of musk and ambergris, and I saw two huge censers, each filled with aloes wood, ambergris and honeyed perfume whose scent filled the room. I saw a horse, black as darkest night, in front of which was a manger of clear crystal, filled with husked sesame, together with a similar manger filled with rosewater scented with musk. The horse was harnessed and bridled and its saddle was of red gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I saw this, I was astonished and said to myself: ‘There must be something of great importance here.’ Satan led me further astray and so I took hold of the horse and mounted it. It didn’t move and so I kicked it, and when it still refused to move, I took the whip and struck it. As soon as it felt the blow, it neighed with a sound like rumbling thunder and, opening up a pair of wings, it flew off with me, carrying me up into the sky way above the ground. After a time, it set me down on a flat roof and whisked its tail across my face, striking out my right eye and causing it to slide down my cheek. It then left me and I came down from the roof to find the ten one-eyed youths. ‘No welcome to you,’ they said. ‘Here I am,’ I replied. ‘I have become like you, and I want you to give me a tray of grime with which to blacken my face and to let me sit with you.’ ‘No, by God,’ they said, ‘you may not do that. Get out!’\n",
      "\n",
      "They drove me away, leaving me in dire straits, thinking over the misfortunes that had overtaken me. I was sad at heart and tearful when I parted from them, and I said to myself in a low voice: ‘I was resting at my ease, but my inquisitiveness would not leave me.’ So I shaved off my beard and whiskers and wandered from place to place. God decreed that I should remain safe and I reached Baghdad yesterday evening, where I found these two men standing in perplexity. I greeted them and introduced myself as a stranger. ‘We too are strangers,’ they said, so we agreed to go together, all of us being dervishes and all being blind in the right eye. This, lady, is why I am clean shaven and have lost my eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You can touch your forelock and go,’ she told him, but he replied: ‘Not before I have heard what these other people have to say.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady of the house then turned to the caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur and said: ‘Tell me your story.’ Ja‘far came forward and told her the story that he had told to the doorkeeper when they entered and when she heard this, she allowed them all to leave. In the lane outside, the caliph asked the dervishes where they were proposing to go as dawn had not yet broken. When they said that they did not know, he told them to come and spend the night with him. ‘Take them,’ he said to Ja‘far, ‘and bring them to me in the morning, so that we may write down what has happened.’ Ja‘far did as he was told and the caliph went up to his palace, but found himself unable to sleep that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, he took his seat on the imperial throne, and when his officials had assembled, he turned to Ja‘far and told him to bring the three ladies, the two bitches and the three dervishes. Ja‘far got up and brought them all, the ladies being veiled. Ja‘far turned to them and said: ‘You are forgiven because of your earlier kindness, although you did not know who we were. I can tell you now that you are standing before the fifth of the caliphs of the Banu ‘Abbas, Harun al-Rashid, the brother of Musa al-Hadi and son of al-Mahdi Muhammad, the son of Abu Ja‘far al-Mansur, the son of Muhammad, the brother of al-Saffah, son of Muhammad. You are to tell nothing but the truth.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies heard what Ja‘far had said as spokesman for the Commander of the Faithful, the eldest of them came forward and said to the caliph: ‘Commander of the Faithful, mine is a story which, were it written with needles on the inner corners of the eyeballs of mankind, would serve as a warning to those who take heed and counsel to those who profit from counsel.’\n",

      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that the lady continued to prompt him to leave with her until he said yes. THE LADY WENT ON:\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent the night at his feet, unable to believe what had happened to me because of my joy. In the morning, we got up and, going to the treasuries, we took what was both light to carry and valuable, after which we left the castle and went down to the city. There we met the slaves and the ship’s captain, who were searching for me and who were filled with joy when they saw me. I told them, to their astonishment, what I had seen and explained to them the story of the young man and the reason for the curse that had struck the city, as well as what had happened to its people. When my sisters, now these two bitches, saw me with the young man, they became jealous of me and angry, and they secretly schemed against me. We boarded the ship gaily, overjoyed at the profit we had made, although I was more pleased because of the young man. We stayed waiting for a wind, and when it blew fair, we made sail and set off. My sisters sat with me and we started to talk. ‘What are you going to do with this handsome young man?’ they asked. ‘I intend to take him as my husband,’ I replied. Then, turning, I went up to him and said: ‘Sir, I want to say something to you and I would ask you not to refuse me. When we reach Baghdad, our city, I shall propose myself to you in marriage; you shall be my husband and I shall be your wife.’ He agreed to this, and I turned to my sisters and said: ‘This young man is enough for me, so whatever profit others have made, they can keep.’ ‘That is well done of you,’ they said, but secretly they continued to plot against me.\n",
      "\n",
      "On we sailed with a fair wind until we left the Sea of Fear and reached safety. After a few more days of sailing, we came in sight of the walls of Basra. Evening fell and we settled down to sleep, but then my sisters got up, carried me on my mattress and threw me into the sea. They did the same thing with the young man, and as he could not swim well, he was drowned and God entered him in the roll of the martyrs. I wish that I had drowned with him, but God decreed that I should be saved, and so while I was floating in the sea, He provided me with a plank of wood on to which I climbed. The waves then swept me along until they threw me up on the shore of an island. There I walked for the rest of the night and, when morning came, I saw a track just broad enough for a human foot that connected the island to the mainland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had now risen and I dried my clothes in the sunlight, ate some of the island fruits and drank from its water. Then I set off on the track and went on walking until I was close to the mainland and only two hours away from the city. Suddenly, I saw a snake as thick as a palm tree darting towards me, and as it came I could see it swerving to right and to left until it reached me. Its tongue was trailing along the ground for the length of a span and it was sweeping aside the dust with the whole length of its body. It was being pursued by a dragon, thin and long as a lance. In its flight the snake turned to the right and the left, but the dragon seized its tail. The snake shed tears and its tongue lolled out because of its violent efforts to escape. Feeling sorry for it, I picked up a stone and threw it at the dragon’s head, killing it instantly, after which the snake unfolded a pair of wings and flew up into the sky until it passed out of my sight.\n",

      "I sat there in amazement, but I was tired and sleepy and so, for a time, I fell asleep where I was. When I awoke I found at my feet a girl with two bitches who was massaging my feet. I felt embarrassed by her presence and so I sat up and said: ‘Sister, who are you?’ ‘How quickly you have forgotten me,’ she replied. ‘I am the one to whom you did a service, killing my foe and sowing the seed of gratitude. I am the snake whom you saved from the dragon. I am one of the jinn, as was the dragon. He was my enemy and it was only because of you that I escaped from him. After that, I flew on the wind to the ship from which your sisters threw you overboard, and after taking all its cargo to your house, I sank it. As for your sisters, I turned them into two black bitches, for I know the whole story of their dealings with you, but as for the young man, he had already drowned.’ She then carried me off, together with the bitches, and set me down on the roof of my house, in the middle of which I could see all the goods that had been on the ship, not one thing being missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the snake girl said: ‘By the inscription on the ring of our lord Solomon, on whom be peace, if you do not give each of these bitches three hundred lashes every day, I shall come and turn you into a bitch like them.’ I told her that I would obey, and so, Commander of the Faithful, I have gone on beating them, although I feel pity for them and they realize that this is not my fault and accept my excuse. This is my story.\n",
      "\n",
      "The caliph was filled with wonder, and he then asked the doorkeeper the reason for the whip scars on her body. ‘Commander of the Faithful,’ she replied, ‘when my father died he left a great quantity of wealth, and soon afterwards I married the wealthiest man of his time.’ she went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed with him for a year, but he too then died and from him I inherited eighty thousand gold dinars, this being my portion in accordance with Islamic law. I was then exceedingly rich; my reputation spread, and I had ten costumes made, each worth a thousand dinars. As I was sitting one day, in came an old woman with pendulous cheeks, thinning eyebrows, popping eyes, broken teeth and a blotched face. She was bleary-eyed, with a head that looked as though it had been covered in plaster, grey hair and a bent body covered in scabs. Her skin was discoloured and she was dribbling mucus, as the poet has described:\n",
      "\n",
      "An old woman of evil omen – may God have no mercy on her youth\n",
      "\n",
      "Or pardon her sins the day she comes to die –\n",
      "\n",
      "She could lead a thousand bolting mules\n",
      "\n",
      "With a spider’s web for reins, so domineering is she.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On entering, this woman greeted me and after she had kissed the ground before me, she said: ‘I have a fatherless daughter and tonight is her wedding and the ceremony of her unveiling. We are strangers with no acquaintances in this city and our hearts are broken. Were you to come to the wedding, you would win reward and recompense from God, as the ladies of the city would hear that you were going and would come themselves. You would then mend my daughter’s broken heart, for her only helper is God.’ She then wept, kissed my feet and recited the lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Your presence there would honour us,\n",
      "\n",
      "And that we would acknowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "While if you do not come,\n",
      "\n",
      "We have no substitute and no replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Moved by pity and compassion, I agreed, saying: ‘I shall do something for her, if God wills, and she shall be married in my clothes with my jewellery and my finery.’ The old woman was delighted: she bent down to kiss my feet and said: ‘May God reward you and mend your heart as you have mended mine. But do not trouble yourself to do this service now. If you are ready in the evening, I will come and fetch you.’ She then kissed my hand and left. I was ready when she came back and she said: ‘My lady, the women of the town have come. I told them that you were going to be there and they were delighted and are waiting for you to arrive.’ So I drew my veil and got up, taking my maids with me, and I went on until we came to a lane that had been swept and sprinkled with water, and where a cool breeze was blowing. There we arrived at an arched gate with a strongly built marble dome, leading to the door of a palace that soared from the ground to touch the clouds. Over the gate these lines were inscribed:\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a house built for pleasure\n",
      "\n",
      "And consecrated for all time to joy and relaxation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my centre is a fountain with gushing waters\n",
      "\n",
      "That clear away all sorrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flowers border it – anemones and the rose,\n",
      "\n",
      "Myrtle, narcissus blooms and camomile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got to the door, the old woman knocked, and when it was opened, we went in to find a hall spread with carpets, in which lighted lamps were hanging and candles were ranged, with gems and precious stones. We walked through the hall until we came to a room of unparalleled splendour, spread with silken rugs and lit by hanging lamps and two rows of candles. In the centre of it there was a couch of juniper wood studded with pearls and gems and covered with a buttoned canopy of satin. Before we knew what was happening, out came a girl. I looked at her, Commander of the Faithful, and saw that she was more perfect than the moon at its full, with a forehead brighter than daybreak, as the poet has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the palaces of the Caesars she is a maiden\n",
      "\n",
      "From among the bashful ones of the Chosroes’ courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "On her cheeks are rosy tokens;\n",
      "\n",
      "How beautiful are those red cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "A slender girl with a languid, sleepy glance,\n",
      "\n",
      "She encompasses all beauty’s graces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lock of hair that hangs above her forehead\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the night of care set over joyful dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She emerged from beneath the canopy and greeted me as her dear and revered sister, giving me a thousand welcomes and reciting:\n",
      "\n",
      "Were the house to know who comes to visit it,\n",
      "\n",
      "It would kiss in joyfulness the place where you have trod.\n",
      "\n",
      "And call out with its silent voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Welcome to the generous and noble one.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She then sat down and said: ‘Sister, I have a brother who has seen you at a number of weddings and festivals. He is a young man more handsome than I am, and he is deeply in love with you because of the richness of beauty and grace that you possess. He has heard that you are the mistress of your people, as he is the master of his. Because he wished to attach himself to you, he played this trick in order that I should meet you. He wants to marry you in accordance with the ordinance of God and of His Apostle, and there is no disgrace in what is lawful.’ When I heard what she had to say and saw that I was now inside the house, I told her that I would agree. She was delighted and, after clapping her hands, she opened a door from which emerged a young man in the bloom of his youth, immaculately dressed, well built, handsome, graceful, splendid and perfect, with engaging manners. His eyebrows were like an archer’s bow and his eyes could steal hearts with licit magic, as the poet’s description has it:\n",
      "\n",
      "His face is like a crescent moon,\n",
      "\n",
      "Where marks of good fortune are like pearls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How excellent also are the lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Blessed is his beauty and blessed is our God.\n",
      "\n",
      "How great is He who formed and shaped this man!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alone he has acquired all loveliness,\n",
      "\n",
      "And in his beauty all mankind strays lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon his cheek beauty has written these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I testify there is no handsome man but he.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I looked at him, my heart turned to him and I fell in love. He sat beside me and I talked to him for an hour, after which the girl clapped her hands for a second time. The door of a side room opened and from it emerged a qadi with four witnesses, who greeted us and then sat down. The marriage contract between me and the young man was drawn up, after which the others withdrew. ‘May this be a blessed night,’ said my bridegroom, turning to me. ‘But, my lady,’ he added, ‘I impose one condition on you.’ ‘What is that?’ I asked. He got up and fetched a copy of the Quran and said: ‘Swear that you will not look at any other man but me, or incline to him.’ I swore to that, to his great joy. He embraced me and my whole heart was filled with love for him. Servants then set out a table and we ate and drank our fill. Night fell and he took me to bed, where we continued to kiss and embrace until morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continued in this state for a month, living in happiness and joy, and at the end of that time I asked my husband’s leave to go to market to buy some material. After he had given me permission, I put on an outdoor mantle, and taking with me the old woman and a servant girl, I went down to the market. There I sat in the shop of a young merchant who was known to the old woman. She told me that he was a youth whose father had died, leaving him a huge amount of money. ‘He has a great stock of goods,’ she added. ‘You will find whatever you want, and no trader in the market has finer fabrics.’ Then she told the man to produce for me the most expensive stuff that he had and he replied: ‘To hear is to obey.’ The old woman then began to sing his praises, but I told her: ‘There is no necessity for this. All we want is to get what we need and then to go back home.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The man brought out what we were looking for and we produced the money for him, but he refused to take anything and said: ‘This is a guest gift for you today from me.’ I said to the old woman: ‘If he refuses to accept the money, then give him back the stuff.’ ‘By God,’ he said, ‘I shall not accept anything from you, and all this is a gift from me in exchange for a single kiss, which is of more value to me than everything that is in my shop.’ ‘What good will a kiss do you?’ asked the old woman, but then she told me: ‘You heard what he said, daughter. What harm will a kiss do you, and you can then take what you want?’ ‘Don’t you know that I have sworn an oath?’ I asked, but she went on: ‘Stay silent and let him kiss you. You will have done nothing wrong and you can take back this money.’ She continued to inveigle me, until I fell into the trap and agreed. I then covered my eyes and hid myself from the passers-by with the edge of my veil. He put his mouth on my cheek beneath my veil and, after kissing me, he bit me hard, piercing the skin of my cheek so that I fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman held me to her breast and when I recovered my senses, I found the shop closed, with her grieving over me and saying: ‘God has averted what could have been worse.’ Then she said to me: ‘Come back to the house with me and pull yourself together, lest you be shamed. When you get home, go to bed, pretend to be sick and cover yourself up. I will fetch you something with which to treat this bite and it will soon be better.’ After a while, I got up, full of care and extremely fearful, and I walked very slowly home, where I acted as though I was sick. At nightfall, in came my husband. He asked: ‘My lady, what happened to you while you were out?’ ‘I’m not well,’ I said, ‘and I have a headache.’ He looked at me, lit a candle and came up to me. ‘What is this wound on your tender cheek?’ he asked. ‘After receiving your permission to go out today to buy materials, I left the house but was pushed by a camel carrying firewood; my veil was torn and, as you can see, I got this wound on my cheek, for the streets are narrow here.’ ‘Tomorrow I will go to the governor,’ he said, ‘and tell him to hang everyone who sells firewood in the city.’ I implored him not to burden himself with the guilt of wronging someone, adding: ‘I was riding on a donkey which threw me and I fell on the ground where I struck a piece of wood which grazed my cheek and wounded me.’ He said: ‘Tomorrow I shall go to Ja‘far the Barmecide and tell him what happened to you, so that he may put every donkey driver in this city to death.’ ‘Are you going to kill everyone because of me?’ I asked. ‘What happened was a matter of fate and destiny.’ ‘It must be done,’ he said, and he kept on insisting on this until, when he got up, I turned around and spoke sharply to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that, Commander of the Faithful, he realized what had happened to me. ‘You have been false to your oath,’ he said, letting out a great cry. The door opened and seven black slaves came in. On his orders, they dragged me from my bed and threw me down in the middle of the room. He told one of them to hold my shoulders and to sit on my head, while another was to sit on my knees and hold my feet. A third came with a sword in his hand and my husband ordered him to strike me with the sword and cut me in two and then said: ‘Let each of you take a piece and throw it into the Tigris as food for the fish. This is the reward of those who betray their oaths and are false to their love.’ He grew even more angry and recited these verses:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I must have a partner in my love,\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though passion slay me, I shall drive love from my soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "I say to my soul: ‘Die nobly,\n",
      "\n",
      "For there is no good in a love that is opposed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he told the slave: ‘Strike, Sa‘d.’ When the slave was sure that his master meant what he said, he sat over me and said: ‘Lady, recite the confession of faith, and if there is anything that you want done, tell me, for this is the end of your life.’ ‘Wait a little, good slave,’ I said, ‘so that I can give you my last instructions.’ Then I raised my head and saw the state that I was in and how I had fallen from greatness to degradation. My tears flowed and I wept bitterly, but my husband recited angrily:\n",
      "\n",
      "Say to one who has tired of union and turned from me,\n",
      "\n",
      "Being pleased to take another partner in love:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I had enough of you before you had enough of me,\n",
      "\n",
      "And what has passed between us is enough for me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard that, Commander of the Faithful, I wept and, looking at him, I recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "You have abandoned me in my love and have sat back;\n",
      "\n",
      "You have left my swollen eyelids sleepless and have slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "You made a pact between my eyes and sleeplessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart does not forget you, nor are my tears concealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "You promised to be faithful in your love,\n",
      "\n",
      "But played the traitor when you won my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved you as a child who did not know of love,\n",
      "\n",
      "So do not kill me now that I am learning it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask you in God’s Name that, if I die,\n",
      "\n",
      "You write upon my tomb: ‘Here lies a slave of love.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be that a sad one who knows love’s pangs\n",
      "\n",
      "Will pass this lover’s heart of mine and feel compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On finishing these lines, I shed more tears, but when my husband heard them and saw my tears, he became even angrier and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "I left the darling of my heart not having tired of her,\n",
      "\n",
      "But for a sin that she was guilty of.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wanted a partner to share in our love,\n",
      "\n",
      "But my heart’s faith rejects a plural god.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had finished his lines, I pleaded with him tearfully, telling myself that if I could get round him with words, he might spare my life, even if he were to take everything that I had. So I complained to him of my sufferings and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Treat me with justice and do not kill me;\n",
      "\n",
      "The sentence of separation is unjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "You loaded me with passion’s heavy weight,\n",
      "\n",
      "Although even one shirt is too much for my strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not surprised that my life should be lost;\n",
      "\n",
      "My wonder is how, after your loss, my body can be recognized.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I finished the lines weeping, but he looked at me and rebuffed and reviled me, reciting:\n",
      "\n",
      "You left me for another and made clear\n",
      "\n",
      "You were forsaking me; this is not how we were.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall abandon you as you abandoned me,\n",
      "\n",
      "Enduring without you as you endure my loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cease to occupy myself with you,\n",
      "\n",
      "For you have occupied yourself with someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The severance of our love is set at your door, not at mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On finishing these lines, he shouted at the slave: ‘Cut her in half and let us be rid of her, for there is no good to be got from her.’ While we were sparring with each other in this exchange of verses and I had become certain I would die, despairing of life and commending my affair to Almighty God, suddenly in came the old woman, who threw herself at my husband’s feet, kissed them and said tearfully: ‘My son, I have brought you up and served you. I conjure you by this to spare this girl, for she has not committed a crime that deserves death. You are very young and I am afraid lest she involve you in sin – as the saying goes, “Every killer is killed.” What is this slut? Cast her off from you, from your mind and from your heart.’ Then she wept and she kept on pressing him until he agreed and said: ‘I shall spare her life, but I must mark her in a way that will stay with her for the rest of her life.’ On his orders, the slaves then dragged me off, stripped me of my clothes and stretched me out. They sat on me while he fetched a rod from a quince tree and set about beating me. He went on striking my back and sides so severely that I lost consciousness, giving up hope of life. He then told the slaves that when night fell they should take the old woman with them as a guide, carry me off and throw me into my old house. They did as they were told and after throwing me into the house, they went off.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not until daybreak that I recovered from my faint and I then tried to soothe my wounds, treating my body with salves and medicines. As you can see, my ribs continued to look as though they had been struck with clubs, and for four months I remained weak and bedridden, tending to my own wounds until I recovered and was cured. I then went to the house that had been the scene of my downfall, only to find it ruined and reduced to a pile of rubble, with the lane in which it stood totally demolished. I could find no news of what had happened and so I came to my half-sister, with whom I found these two black bitches. After greeting her, I told her everything that had happened to me. ‘My sister,’ she said, ‘who is unscathed by the misfortunes of Time? Praise be to God who brought a safe ending to this affair,’ and she started to recite:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She then told me her own story, of what had happened to her with her sisters and how they had ended up. I stayed there with her and the word ‘marriage’ never crossed our lips. We were then joined by this girl who acts as our housekeeper, going out each day to buy what we need for the next twenty-four hours. Things went on like this until last night. Our sister had gone out as usual to buy our food when she returned with the porter, and the three dervishes arrived shortly afterwards. We talked with them, brought them in and treated them well. After only a little of the night had passed, we were joined by three respectable merchants from Mosul. They told us their story and we talked with them, but we had imposed a condition on all our visitors, which they broke. We paid them back for this breach and asked them all for their stories, which they recited. We then forgave them and they left. Today, before we knew what was happening, we were brought before you. This is our story.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that the dervish said to the lady of the house, to Ja‘far and the caliph and the rest of the company that were listening: ‘My uncle struck his son with his shoe, as he lay there, burned black as charcoal.’ HE WENT ON:\n",
      "\n",
      "This astonished me and I was filled with grief for my cousin and at the fate that had overtaken him and the girl. ‘By God, uncle,’ I said, ‘remove rancour from your heart. My heart and mind are filled with concern; I am saddened by what has happened to my cousin, and by the fact that he and this girl have been left like charcoal. Is their fate not enough for you that you strike your son with your shoe?’ He said: ‘Nephew, from his earliest days this son of mine was passionately in love with his sister. I used to keep him away from her and I would tell myself: “They are only children,” but when they grew up they committed a foul sin. I heard of this and, although I did not believe it, I seized him and reproached him bitterly, saying: “Beware of doing what no one has done before you or will do after you and which will remain as a source of disgrace and disparagement among the kings until the end of time, as the news is carried by the caravans. Take care not to act like this or else I shall be angry with you and kill you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I kept him away from her and kept her from him, but the damned girl was deeply in love with him and Satan got the upper hand and made their actions seem good to them. When my son saw that I was keeping him from his sister, he constructed this underground chamber, set it in order and provisioned it, as you see. Then, taking me unawares when I had gone out hunting, he came here, but the Righteous God was jealous of them and consumed them both with fire, while their punishment in the next world will be harsher and stronger.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He then wept and I wept with him, and he looked at me and said: ‘You are my son in his place.’ I thought for a time about this world and its happenings and of how my father had been killed by his vizier, who had then taken his place and who had plucked out my eye, and I thought of the strange fate of my cousin. I wept and my uncle wept with me. Then we climbed back up and replaced the cover and the earth and restored the tomb as it had been, after which we returned to the palace. Before we had sat down, however, we heard the noise of drums, kettledrums and trumpets, the clatter of lances, the shouting of men, the clink of bridles and the neighing of horses. The sky was darkened by sand and dust kicked up by horses’ hooves and we were bewildered, not knowing what had happened. When we asked, we were told that the vizier who had taken my father’s kingdom had fitted out his troops, collected men, hired Bedouin, and come with an army like the sands that could not be numbered and which no one could withstand. They had made a surprise attack on the city, which had proved unable to resist and which had surrendered to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, my uncle was killed and I fled to the edge of the city, saying to myself: ‘If I fall into this man’s hands, he will kill me.’ Fresh sorrows were piled on me; I remembered what had happened to my father and to my uncle and I wondered what to do, for if I showed myself, the townspeople and my father’s men would recognize me and I would be killed. The only way of escape that I could find was to shave off my beard and my moustache, which I did, and after that I changed my clothes and went out of the city. I then came here, hoping that someone might take me to the Commander of the Faithful, the caliph of the Lord of creation, so that I might talk to him and tell him the story of what had happened to me. I got here tonight and was at a loss to know where to go when I came to where this dervish was standing. I greeted him and told him that I was a stranger, at which he said: ‘I too am a stranger.’ While we were talking, our third companion here came up to us, greeted us, introducing himself as a stranger, to which we made the same reply. We then walked on as darkness fell and fate led us to you. This is the story of why my beard and moustache have been shaved and of how I lost my eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady said: ‘Touch your forelock and go.’ ‘Not before I hear someone else’s tale,’ the man replied. The others wondered at his story and the caliph said to Ja‘far: ‘By God, I have never seen or heard the like of what has happened to this dervish.’ The second dervish then came forward and kissed the ground. HE SAID:\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady, I was not born one-eyed and my story is a marvellous one which, were it written with needles on the inner corners of the eyes of men, would serve as a warning to those who take heed. I was a king, the son of a king. I studied the seven readings of the Quran; I read books and discussed them with men of learning; I studied astronomy, poetry and all other branches of knowledge until I surpassed all the people of my time, while my calligraphy was unrivalled. My fame spread through all lands and among all kings. So it was that the king of India heard of me and he sent a messenger to my father, together with gifts and presents suitable for royalty, to ask for me. My father equipped me with six ships and after a full month’s voyage we came to land.\n",

      "We unloaded the horses that we had taken on board with us and we loaded ten camels with presents, but we had only travelled a short way when suddenly we saw a dust cloud which rose and spread until it filled the sky. After a while, it cleared away to show beneath it fifty mail-clad horsemen like scowling lions, and on closer inspection we could see that they were Bedouin highwaymen. When they saw our small numbers, and that we had ten camels laden with gifts for the king of India, they rushed at us with levelled lances. We gestured to them with our fingers and said: ‘We are envoys on our way to the great king of India, so do not harm us.’ ‘We don’t live in his country,’ they told us, ‘and are no subjects of his.’ Then they killed some of my servants, while the rest took flight. I was badly wounded and I too fled, but the Bedouin did not pursue me, being too busy sorting through the money and the gifts that we had brought with us.\n",

      "Having been cast down from my position of power, I went off with no notion of where I was going, and I carried on until I reached the top of a mountain, where I took refuge in a cave until daybreak. I continued travelling like this until I came to a strong and secure city, from which cold winter had retreated, while spring had come with its roses. Flowers were blooming; there were gushing streams and the birds were singing. It fitted the description of the poet:\n",

      "As I was tired out with walking and pale with care, I was glad to get there. With my changed circumstances, I had no idea where to go. Passing by a tailor in his shop, I greeted him and he returned my greeting and welcomed me with cheerful friendliness. When he asked me why I had left my own country, I told him what had happened to me from beginning to end. He was sorry for me and said: ‘Young man, don’t tell anyone about yourself, as I am afraid lest the king of this city might do you some harm as he is one of your father’s greatest enemies and has a blood feud with him.’ He then produced food and drink and he and I ate together. I chatted with him that night and he gave me a place to myself at the side of his shop and fetched me what I needed in the way of bedding and blankets.\n",

      "I stayed with him for three days, and he then asked: ‘Do you know any craft by which to make your living?’ I told him: ‘I am a lawyer, a scientist, a scribe, a mathematician and a calligrapher.’ ‘There is no market for that kind of thing here,’ he replied. ‘No one in this city has any knowledge of science or of writing and their only concern is making money.’ ‘By God,’ I said, ‘I know nothing apart from what I have told you.’ He said: ‘Tighten your belt, take an axe and a rope and bring in firewood from the countryside. This will give you a livelihood until God brings you relief, but don’t let people know who you are or else you will be killed.’ He then brought me an axe and a rope and handed me over to some woodcutters, telling them to look after me. I went out with them and collected wood for a whole day, after which I carried back a load on my head and sold it for half a dinar. With part of this I bought food and the rest I saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went on like this for a year, and then when the year was up, I came out to the countryside one day, as usual, and as I was wandering there alone I found a tree-filled hollow where there was wood aplenty. Going down into the hollow, I came across a thick tree stump and dug round it, removing the soil. My axe then happened to strike against a copper ring and, on clearing away the earth, I discovered a wooden trapdoor, which I opened. Below it appeared a flight of steps, and when I reached the bottom of these, I saw a door, on entering which I saw a most beautiful palace set with pillars. In it I found a girl like a splendid pearl, one to banish from the heart all trace of care, sorrow and distress, while her words would dispel worries and would leave a man, however intelligent and sensible, robbed of his senses. She was of medium height, with rounded breasts and soft cheeks; she was radiant and beautifully formed, with a face shining in the black night of her hair, while the gleam of her mouth was reflected on her breast. She was as the poet said:\n",

      "Dark-haired and slim-waisted,\n",
      "\n",
      "Her buttocks were like sand dunes\n",

      "\n",
      "Except to pierce my heart and shed my blood:\n",
      "\n",
      "A radiant forehead, hair like night,\n",

      "When I looked at her, I praised the Creator for the beauty and loveliness that He had produced in her. She looked at me in turn and asked: ‘What are you, a human or one of the jinn?’ ‘A human,’ I told her, and she asked: ‘Who brought you to this place where I have been for twenty-five years without ever seeing a fellow human?’ I found her speech so sweet that it filled my heart, and I said, ‘It was my lucky stars that brought me here, my lady, to drive away my cares and sorrows.’ Then I told her from beginning to end what had happened to me and she found my plight hard to bear and wept. ‘I, for my part,’ she said, ‘will now tell you my own story. You must know that I am the daughter of King Iftamus, lord of the Ebony Islands. He had given me in marriage to my cousin, but on my wedding night I was snatched away by an ‘ifrit named Jirjis, son of Rajmus, the son of the maternal aunt of Iblis. He flew off with me and brought me down into this place, where he fetched everything that was needed – clothes, ornaments, fabrics, furniture, food, drink and everything else. He comes once every ten days, sleeps here for the night and then goes on his way, as he took me without the permission of his own people. He has promised me that if I need anything night or day, and if I touch with my hand these two lines inscribed on the inside of this dome, before I take my hand away he shall appear before me. Today is the fourth day since he was here, and so there are six left until he comes again. Would you like to stay with me for five days and you can then leave one day before he returns?’ ‘Yes,’ I replied. ‘How splendid it is when dreams come true!’\n",
      "\n",
      "This made her glad and, rising to her feet, she took me by the hand and led me through an arched door to a fine, elegant bath. When I saw this, I took off my clothes and she took off hers. After bathing, she stepped out and sat on a bench with me by her side. Then she poured me out wine flavoured with musk and brought food. We ate and talked, until she said: ‘Sleep, rest, for you are tired.’ Forgetting all my troubles, I thanked her and fell asleep. When I woke, I found her massaging my feet. ‘God bless you,’ I said and we sat there talking for a time. ‘By God,’ she said, ‘I was unhappy, living by myself under the ground, with no one to talk to me for twenty-five years. Praise be to God, Who has sent you to me.’ Then she asked me whether I would like some wine, and when I said yes, she went to a cupboard and produced old wine in a sealed flask. She then set out some green branches, took the wine and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Had I known you were coming, I would have spread\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart’s blood or the pupils of my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "My cheeks would have been a carpet when we met\n",

      "So that you could have walked over my eyelids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had finished these lines, I thanked her; love of her had taken possession of my heart and my cares and sorrows were gone. We sat drinking together until nightfall, and I then passed with her a night the like of which I had never known in my life. When morning came we were still joining delights to delights, and this went on until midday. I was so drunk that I had lost my senses and I got up, swaying right and left, and I said: ‘Get up, my beauty, and I will bring you out from under the earth and free you from this ‘ifrit.’ She laughed and said: ‘Be content with what you have and stay silent. Out of every ten days he will have one and nine will be for you.’ But drunkenness had got the better of me and I said: ‘I shall now smash the dome with the inscription; let him come, so that I may kill him, for I am accustomed to killing ‘ifrits.’ On hearing this, she turned pale and exclaimed: ‘By God, don’t do it!’ Then she recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is something that will destroy you,\n",
      "\n",
      "Protect yourself from it.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that when the lady of the house stood before the caliph, SHE SAID:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mine is a strange story. The two black bitches are my sisters. Three of us were full sisters and these two, the doorkeeper and the housekeeper, were born of a different mother. When our father died, each of us took her share of the inheritance. Some days later, my mother died, leaving us three thousand dinars, and so each of us, I being the youngest, inherited a thousand dinars. My sisters were thus equipped with dowries and each married. Their husbands stayed for a time, but then they collected trade goods and, each of them taking a thousand dinars from his wife, they all went off on a voyage together, leaving me behind. They were away for five years, during which time the men lost their money and were ruined, abandoning their wives in foreign parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "After five years, my eldest sister came to me in the most squalid of states, dressed as a beggar, with tattered clothes and a dirty old shawl. When I saw her, I didn’t recognize her at first and took no notice of her. Then, realizing who she was, I asked her what had happened, but she said: ‘It is no use talking, sister, the pen of fate has written God’s decree.’ So I sent her to the baths, gave her clothes to wear and said: ‘Sister, you have been given to me in exchange for my father and mother. My share of what the three of us inherited has been blest by God and it has allowed me to thrive and become prosperous. You and I are equal partners.’ I treated her with all kindness and she stayed with me for a whole year.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were concerned about our other sister, but it was not long before she too arrived in an even worse plight than the eldest. I treated her even better than I had treated her sister and both of them shared in my wealth. Some time later, they told me that they wanted to marry again as they could not bear to remain without husbands. ‘My dears,’ I said, ‘there is no longer any benefit to be got from marriage and good men are hard to find now. I don’t see any advantage in your proposal and you have already had experience of marriage.’ My sisters did not accept that and married without my approval although I covered all their costs. They then left with their husbands, who very soon afterwards played them false, took all that they had and went off, abandoning them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again they came back to me, covered in shame, apologized and said: ‘Don’t blame us. You may be younger than us but you are more intelligent; we shall never again mention marriage, so take us as your slave girls that we may have a bite to eat.’ ‘Welcome, sisters,’ I said. ‘No one is dearer to me than you.’ And I kissed them and honoured them even more than before. This went on for a full year, after which I decided to fit out a ship to go to Basra. I chose a large one and loaded it with goods, merchandise and everything needed for the voyage. I asked my sisters whether they would prefer to sit at home until I returned from my voyage or whether they would like to come with me. ‘We will go with you,’ they said, ‘as we cannot bear to be parted from you,’ and so I took them along.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had divided my wealth in two, taking half with me and leaving the other half behind, with the idea that, were the ship to be wrecked and we survived, there would be something to support us on our return. We sailed for some days and nights, but the ship then went astray as the captain had not kept to the right course, and without realizing it, we were sailing in the wrong direction. This went on for some time and over a period of ten days we had fair winds. After that, the lookout climbed up to investigate; he called out: ‘Good news!’ and came down full of joy and told us that he had seen what looked like a city resembling a dove. We were delighted and, within an hour, we could see the place in the distance. We asked the captain its name, but he said: ‘By God, I don’t know. I have never seen it before and never in my life have I sailed on this sea. But things have turned out safely and all we have to do is put in to harbour. Look out your merchandise and if you can sell, sell and then buy up whatever is there; if that does not work, we can rest here for two days, buy provisions and go on with our voyage.’\n",
      "\n",
      "We put in and the captain went up to the city. He was away for a time and when he came back he told us: ‘Come up and wonder at what God has done to those He created, and seek refuge from His anger.’ We went to the city and when we came to the gate, we saw that it was guarded by men with sticks in their hands, but when we got nearer we found that they had been turned to stone, while in the city itself we found that everyone had been transformed to black stone and there was no trace of life. We were astonished, but as we threaded our way through the markets, we discovered that the traders’ wares and the gold and silver had remained unchanged. This delighted us and, thinking that there must be some mystery here, we split up and walked through the city streets, each concerned to collect her own booty, money and fabrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I myself went to the castle, which turned out to be strongly fortified, and I then entered the royal apartments, where all the utensils were made of gold and silver. There I saw the king wearing robes of bewildering splendour, seated with his chamberlains, officers and viziers. When I approached, I found that he was sitting on a throne studded with pearls and gems, wearing cloth of gold, with every jewel gleaming like a star. Standing around him were fifty mamluks, dressed in silks of various kinds, with drawn swords in their stone hands – an astonishing sight. I then walked into the hall of the harem, whose walls were covered with hangings of silk with gold-embroidered branches. The queen was there asleep, wearing a robe ornamented with fresh pearls. On her head was a crown studded with gemstones of all kinds, while around her neck were necklaces of all sorts. Everything she was wearing, dress and ornaments, was unchanged, but she herself had been transformed to black stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then found an open door and went up to it. There were seven steps and these led to a chamber whose marble floor was spread with gold-embroidered carpets. In it there was a couch made of juniper wood, inset with pearls and precious stones, together with two large emeralds, covered by a pearl-studded hanging. There was also a door from which I could see a light shining. I went to stand over it and there in the centre on a small chair I found a jewel the size of a duck’s egg, burning like a candle and shedding light, while spread over the couch was an amazing array of silks. The sight filled me with astonishment. On looking further, I saw lighted candles. ‘Someone must have lit these,’ I said to myself, and I then went to another room and proceeded to search all through the building, forgetting myself in my astonishment at all this and plunged in thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "I continued exploring until nightfall, but then, wishing to leave, I found I had lost my way and had no idea where the gate was. So I went back to the chamber with the lighted candles, sat down on the couch and, after reciting a portion of the Quran, wrapped myself in a coverlet, trying in vain to sleep but becoming uneasy. Then at midnight I heard a beautiful voice reciting the Quran. This filled me with joy and I followed the sound until I came to a small room whose door was shut. I opened it and looked inside, to find a chapel with a prayer niche in which hung lighted lamps together with two candles. In this chapel a prayer rug had been put down and on this sat a handsome young man with, before him, a copy of the holy Quran from which he was reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wondering how he alone had been saved from out of all the inhabitants of the city, I entered and greeted him. He looked up and returned my greeting, at which I said: ‘By the truth of what you have recited from the Book of God, I implore you to answer my question.’ He looked at me, smiling, and replied: ‘Servant of God, do you tell me why you came here and I will tell you what happened to me and the people of this city and how it was that I escaped.’ So I told him my story, which filled him with wonder, and then I asked him about the townspeople. ‘Wait, sister,’ he said, and he then closed the Quran and put it into a bag of satin, before making me sit beside him. When I looked at him, I saw him to be the moon when it comes to the full, excellent in his attributes, supple and handsome; his appearance was like a sugar stick, with a well-proportioned frame.

      "The glance that I gave him was followed by a thousand sighs and love for him was fixed in my heart. ‘My master,’ I said, ‘answer my question.’ ‘Willingly,’ he replied, and he went on: ‘Know, servant of God, that this is my father’s city and he is the king whom you saw sitting on the throne turned into black stone, while the queen whom you saw in the hall is my mother. All the people of the city were Magians, worshipping fire rather than Almighty God. They would swear by fire, light, shadows, the heat of the sun and the circling sphere. After my father had for long been without a son, late in his life I was born to him. He brought me up until I was a grown man, and good fortune always preceded me. With us there was an old Muslim woman who believed in God and His Apostle in secret, while in public she followed the practices of my people. My father had faith in her because he saw that she was trustworthy and chaste, and he showed her great respect, thinking that she was his co-religionary. When I grew older he entrusted me to her, saying: “Take him; give him a good upbringing; ground him in the tenets of our faith and look after him.” When she had taken me, she taught me about the religion of Islam with the obligations of ritual purification and of prayer, and she made me learn the Quran by heart, telling me to worship none but Almighty God. When she had done all this, she told me to keep it hidden from my father and not to tell him lest he kill me. So I kept the secret for a few days, but then the old woman died and the people of the city sank ever further into unbelief and presumptuous error.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘While they were in this state, suddenly they heard a mighty voice like the rumbling of thunder, calling out in tones that could be heard far and near: “Citizens, turn away from the worship of fire and worship God, the Merciful King.” The people were startled and they all came to my father, the king, and asked: “What is this alarming voice that we have heard, astounding and terrifying us?” “Do not be alarmed or frightened by it,” he replied, “and do not let it turn you from your religion.” Their hearts inclined to what he said; they persisted in their worship of fire and they acted even more wickedly until a year had passed from the first time that they had heard the voice. They then heard it for a second time and, after three years, for a third time – once each year – but they still clung to their beliefs. Then, at dawn one day, divine wrath descended and they, together with their animals and their flocks, were turned to black stone. I was the only one to escape and since that happened, I have been living like this – praying, fasting and reciting the Quran – but I can no longer endure being alone, with no one to keep me company.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I had lost my heart to him, so I asked him whether he would go to Baghdad with me where he could meet the men of learning and the faqihs, and so add to his knowledge, understanding and grasp of religious law. ‘Know,’ I went on, ‘that the slave who stands before you is the mistress of her people, with command over men, eunuchs and slaves. I have a ship laden with merchandise and it was fate that led us here in order that we should see these things, and it was ordained by destiny that you and I should meet.’\n",

      "At this point, they told the porter that it was time for him to get up, put on his gaiters and go – ‘Show us the width of your shoulders.’ ‘By God,’ said the porter, ‘if the breath of life were to leave me, it would be easier for me to bear than having to part from you. Let me link night with day, and in the morning we can all go our separate ways.’ The girl who had bought the provisions pleaded with the others: ‘Let him sleep here so that we can laugh at him. Who knows whether in all our lives we shall meet someone else like him, both wanton and witty.’ They then said: ‘You can only spend the night with us on condition that you accept our authority and that you don’t ask about anything you see or the reason for it.’ The porter agreed to this, and they then told him: ‘Get up and read what is written over the door.’ He went to the door and there he found written above it in gold leaf: ‘Whoever talks about what does not concern him will hear what will not please him.’ ‘I call you to witness,’ he said, ‘that I shall not talk about what is no concern of mine.’\n",

      "The housekeeper got up and prepared a meal for them, which they ate, and then they lit candles and lamps, dipping ambergris and aloes into the candles. They sat drinking and talking of past loves, after having reset the table with fresh fruits and more wine. They continued for a time, eating, drinking, carousing together over their dessert, laughing and teasing each other, when suddenly there was a knock on the door. This did not disrupt the party, however, and one of the girls went by herself to the door and returned to report: ‘Our happiness is complete tonight.’ ‘How is that?’ the others asked. She told them: ‘At the door are three Persian dervishes, with shaven chins, heads and eyebrows. By a very remarkable coincidence, each of them has lost his left eye. They have only just arrived after a journey; they are showing the signs of travel and this is the first time that they have been to our city, Baghdad. They knocked on our door because they couldn’t find a lodging for the night and they had said to themselves: “Perhaps the owner of this house would give us the key to a stable or to a hut in which we could pass the night.” For they had been caught out by nightfall, and, being strangers, they had no acquaintance who might give them shelter – and, sisters, each of them is of a ludicrous appearance.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She continued to persuade and cajole until the others agreed to let the Persians come in on condition that they would not talk about what did not concern them lest they hear what would not please them. The girl went off joyfully and came back with the three one-eyed men, with shaven beards and moustaches. They spoke words of greeting, bowed and hung back. The girls got up to welcome them and, after congratulating them on their safe arrival, told them to be seated.\n",

      "What the visitors saw was a pleasant and clean room, furnished with greenery, where there were lighted candles, incense rising into the air, dessert, fruits and wine, together with three virgin girls. ‘This is good, by God,’ they all agreed. Then they turned to the porter and found him cheerfully tired out and drunk. They thought, on seeing him, that he must be one of their own kind and said: ‘This is a dervish like us, either a foreigner or an Arab.’ Hearing this, the porter glowered at them and said: ‘Sit down and don’t be inquisitive. Didn’t you read what is written over the door? It is not for poor men who arrive like you to let loose your tongues at us.’ The newcomers apologized submissively, and the girls laughed and made peace between them and the porter, after which food was produced for the new arrivals, which they ate.\n",
      "\n",
      "They then sat drinking together, with the doorkeeper pouring the wine and the wine cup circulating among them. The porter then asked the visitors whether they had some story or anecdote to tell. Heated by wine, they, in their turn, asked for musical instruments and were brought a tambourine, a lute and a Persian harp by the doorkeeper. They then got up and tuned the instruments, after which each one took one of them, struck a note and began to sing. The girls added a shrill accompaniment and the noise rose. Then, while this was going on, there was a knock at the door and the doorkeeper got up to see what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason for this knocking was that the caliph Harun al-Rashid was in the habit of going around disguised as a merchant and he had come down from his palace that night on an excursion to listen to the latest news, accompanied by his vizier, Ja‘far, and Masrur, his executioner. On his way through the city, he and his companions had happened to pass that house, where they heard music and singing. He had said to Ja‘far: ‘I want to go in here so that we may listen to these voices and see their owners.’ Ja‘far had replied: ‘Commander of the Faithful, these people are drunk and I am afraid that they may do us some harm.’ The caliph had then said: ‘I must enter and I want you to think of some scheme to get us in.’ ‘To hear is to obey,’ Ja‘far had replied, before going up and knocking on the door. When it was opened by the doorkeeper, Ja‘far advanced and kissed the ground. ‘Lady,’ he said, ‘we are traders from Tiberias who have been in Baghdad for ten days. We have sold our goods and are staying at the merchants’ khan, but this evening we were invited out by a colleague. We went to his house and, after he had given us a meal, we sat drinking with him for a time, but when he let us go night had fallen and, as we are strangers here, we could not find our way back to our hostel. Of your charity, and may God reward you, would you let us come in and spend the night with you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl looked at them and saw that they were dressed as merchants and appeared to be respectable people. So she went back to her sisters and passed on Ja‘far’s message. The others sympathized with the visitors’ plight and told her: ‘Let them in,’ after which she went back and opened the door. The caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur came in and when the girls saw them, they stood up, seated their visitors and ministered to their needs, saying: ‘Welcome to our guests, but we lay a condition on you.’ ‘What is that?’ they asked. ‘That you do not speak of what does not concern you, lest you hear what will not please you.’ ‘We agree,’ they replied, and they sat down to drink together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the three dervishes, the caliph was surprised to find that each of them had lost his left eye. He was also thrown into confusion by the beauty and grace of the girls, which prompted his admiration. They began to drink together and to talk, but when the girls invited the caliph to drink, he said: ‘I am proposing to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca.’ The doorkeeper then got up and brought him an embroidered table cloth on which she set a china jar in which she poured willow-flower water, adding some snow and a sugar lump. The caliph thanked her and said to himself: ‘By God, I shall reward her tomorrow for the good that she has done me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all occupied themselves with drinking, and when the drink had gained the upper hand, the lady of the house got up, bowed to the company and then, taking the housekeeper by the hand, she said: ‘Sisters, come, we must settle our debt.’ ‘Yes,’ agreed the other two girls, and at that, the doorkeeper got up in front of them and first cleared the table, removed the debris, replaced the perfumes and cleared a space in the middle of the room. The dervishes were made to sit on a bench on one side of the room and the caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur on a bench on the other side. Then the lady of the house called to the porter: ‘Your friendship does not amount to much. You are not a stranger, but one of the household.’ The porter got up, tightened his belt and asked: ‘What do you want?’ ‘Stay where you are,’ she said. Then the housekeeper stood up and set a chair in the middle of the room, opened a cupboard and said to the porter: ‘Come and help me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "In the cupboard he saw two black bitches, with chains around their necks. ‘Take them,’ said the girl, and he took them and brought them to the centre of the room. Then the lady of the house got up, rolled back her sleeves and took up a whip. ‘Bring one of them,’ she told the porter, and he did this, pulling the bitch by its chain, as it whimpered and shook its head at the girl. It howled as she struck it on the head, and she continued to beat it until her arms were tired. She then threw away the whip, pressed the bitch to her breast and wiped away its tears with her hand, kissing its head. Then she said to the porter: ‘Take this one away and bring the other.’ This he did and she treated the second bitch in the same way as the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "The caliph was concerned and troubled by this. Unable to contain his curiosity about the story of the two bitches, he winked at Ja‘far, but the latter turned to him and gestured to him to remain silent. Then the lady of the house turned to the doorkeeper and said: ‘Get up and do your duty.’ ‘Yes,’ she replied and, getting up, she went to the couch, which was made of juniper wood with panels of gold and silver. Then the lady of the house said to the other two girls: ‘Bring out what you have.’ The doorkeeper sat on a chair by her side, while the housekeeper went into a closet and came out with a satin bag with green fringes and two golden discs. She stood in front of the lady of the house, unfastened the bag and took from it a lute whose strings she tuned and whose pegs she tightened, until it was all in order. Then she recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "You are the object of my whole desire;\n",
      "\n",
      "Union with you, beloved, is unending bliss,\n",
      "\n",
      "While absence from you is like fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "You madden me, and throughout time\n",

      "I clothe myself in sickness; my excuse is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "For through my love, you lead my heart astray.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flowing tears serve to bring my secret out and make it plain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tearful flood reveals it, and they try\n",
      "\n",
      "To cure the violence of this sickness, but it is you\n",
      "\n",
      "Who are for me both the disease and its cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those whose cure you are, the pains last long.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pine away through the light shed by your eyes,\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is my own love whose sword kills me,\n",
      "\n",
      "A sword that has destroyed many good men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love has no end for me nor can I turn to consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love is my medicine and my code of law;\n",
      "\n",
      "Secretly and openly it serves to adorn me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You bring good fortune to the eye that looks\n",
      "\n",
      "Its fill on you, or manages a glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and its choice of love distracts my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the lady of the house heard these lines, she cried: ‘Oh! Oh! Oh!’, tore her clothes and fell to the ground in a faint. The caliph was astonished to see weals caused by the blows of a whip on her body, but then the doorkeeper got up, sprinkled water over her and clothed her in a splendid dress that she had fetched for her sister. When they saw that, all the men present were disturbed, as they had no idea what lay behind it. The caliph said to Ja‘far: ‘Don’t you see this girl and the marks of a beating that she shows? I can’t keep quiet without knowing the truth of the matter and without finding out about this girl and the two black bitches.’ Ja‘far replied: ‘Master, they made it a condition that we should not talk about what did not concern us, lest we hear what we do not like.’\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, the doorkeeper said: ‘Sister, keep your promise and come to me.’ ‘Willingly,’ said the housekeeper, and she took the lute, cradled it to her breasts, touched it with her fingers and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I complain of the beloved’s absence, what am I to say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Where can I go to reach what I desire?\n",
      "\n",
      "I might send messengers to explain my love,\n",
      "\n",
      "But this complaint no messenger can carry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I may endure, but after he has lost\n",
      "\n",
      "His love, the lover’s life is short.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing remains but sorrow and then grief,\n",
      "\n",
      "With tears that flood the cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may be absent from my sight but you have still\n",
      "\n",
      "A settled habitation in my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder, do you know our covenant?\n",
      "\n",
      "Like flowing water, it does not stay long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you forgotten that you loved a slave,\n",
      "\n",
      "Who finds his cure in tears and wasted flesh?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, if this love unites us once again,\n",

      "When the doorkeeper heard this second poem, she cried out and said: ‘That is good, by God.’ Then she put her hand to her clothes and tore them, as the first girl had done, and fell to the ground in a faint. The housekeeper got up and, after sprinkling her with water, clothed her in a new dress. The doorkeeper then rose and took her seat before saying: ‘Give me more and pay off the debt you owe me.’ So the housekeeper brought her lute and recited:\n",

      "When the doorkeeper heard this poem, she put her hand on her dress and ripped it down to the bottom. She then fell fainting to the ground, showing marks of a beating. The dervishes said: ‘It would have been better to have slept on a dunghill rather than to have come into this house, where our stay has been clouded by something that cuts at the heart.’ ‘Why is that?’ asked the caliph, turning to them. ‘This affair has distressed us,’ they replied. ‘Do you not belong to this household?’ he asked. ‘No,’ they replied. ‘We have never seen the place before.’ The caliph was surprised and said, gesturing at the porter: ‘This man with you may know about them.’ When they asked him, however, he said: ‘By Almighty God, love makes us all equal. I have grown up in Baghdad but this is the only time in my life that I ever entered this house and how I came to be here with these girls is a remarkable story.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The others said: ‘By God, we thought that you were one of them, but now we see that you are like us.’ The caliph then pointed out: ‘We are seven men and they are three women. There is no fourth. So ask them about themselves, and if they don’t reply willingly, we will force them to do so.’ Everyone agreed except for Ja‘far, who said: ‘Let them be; we are their guests and they made a condition which we accepted, as you know. It would be best to let the matter rest, for there is only a little of the night left and we can then go on our ways.’ He winked at the caliph and added: ‘There is only an hour left and tomorrow we can summon them to your court and ask for their story.’ The caliph raised his head and shouted angrily: ‘I cannot bear to wait to hear about them; let the dervishes question them.’ ‘I don’t agree,’ said Ja‘far, and the two of them discussed and argued about who should ask the questions until they both agreed that it should be the porter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady of the house asked what the noise was about and the porter got up and said to her: ‘My lady, these people would like you to tell them the story of the two bitches and how you come to beat them and then to weep and kiss them. They also want to know about your sister and why she has been beaten with rods like a man. These are their questions to you.’ ‘Is it true what he says about you?’ the lady of the house asked the guests, and all of them said yes, except for Ja‘far, who stayed silent. When the lady heard this, she told them: ‘By God, you have done us a great wrong. We started by making it a condition that if any of you talked about what did not concern him, he would hear what would not please him. Wasn’t it enough for you that we took you into our house and shared our food with you? But the fault is not so much yours as that of the one who brought you in to us.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she rolled her sleeve back above the wrist and struck the floor three times, saying: ‘Hurry.’ At this, the door of a closet opened and out came seven black slaves, with drawn swords in their hands. ‘Tie up these men who talk too much,’ she said, ‘and bind them one to the other.’ This the slaves did, after which they said: ‘Lady, give us the order to cut off their heads.’ She replied: ‘Let them have some time so that I may ask them about their circumstances before their heads are cut off.’ ‘God save me,’ said the porter. ‘Don’t kill me, lady, for someone else’s fault. All the rest have done wrong and have committed a fault except me. By God, it would have been a pleasant night had we been saved from these dervishes who entered a prosperous city and then ruined it.’ He recited:\n",

      "1 \t 0.491 \t Then, when it was the seventh night, she continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that, when the fish spoke, the girl overturned the pan with her staff and then left by the way she had come, with the wall closing behind her. At that, the vizier got up and said: ‘This is something which must not be kept from the king.’ So he went to the king and told him the story, explaining what he had seen for himself. ‘I must see this with my own eyes,’ said the king, and at that the fisherman was sent for and told to bring another four fish like the others. He went down to the pool with three guards as an escort and brought the fish immediately. The king ordered him to be given four hundred dinars, after which he turned to the vizier and told him: ‘Come and cook these fish in my presence.’ The vizier did as he was told, brought the pan and, after preparing the fish, he put the pan over the fire and threw them into it. As soon as he did so, the wall split open and out came a black slave, tall as a mountain or like a survivor of the race of ‘Ad. In his hand was a green bough and he asked in a hectoring voice: ‘Fish, fish, are you true to your old covenant?’ The fish raised their heads from the pan and replied: ‘Yes, yes, we keep to our covenant.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you return, we return;\n",
      "\n",
      "If you keep faith, then so do we,\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you go off, we are quits.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The slave came up to the pan, overturned it with the branch that he was holding, and left by the way that he had come. The vizier and the king looked at the fish and saw that they were now like charcoal. The king was amazed and said: ‘This is something that cannot be kept quiet and there must be some secret attached to them.’ So he gave orders for the fisherman to be summoned and when the man came, the king asked him where the fish came from. ‘From a pool surrounded by four mountains,’ replied the fisherman, ‘and it is under the mountain outside the city.’ The king turned and asked: ‘How many days’ journey is it?’ and the fisherman told him that it was half an hour away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This astonished the king and he ordered his troops to mount and ride immediately, with the fisherman at their head, while the fisherman, in his turn, as he accompanied the king, spent his time cursing the ‘ifrit. The riders climbed up the mountain and then went down into a broad plain that they had never seen before in their lives. Everyone, including the king, was filled with wonder when they looked at it and at the pool in its centre, set as it was between four mountains, with its fish of four colours – red, white, yellow and blue. The king halted in astonishment and asked his soldiers and the others there whether they had ever seen the pool before. ‘King of the age,’ they replied, ‘never in all our lives have we set eyes on it.’ The elderly were asked about it, but they too said that they had never before seen the pool there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king then swore by God: ‘I shall not enter my city or sit on my throne again until I find out the secret of this pool and of these fish.’ He gave orders for his men to camp around the mountains, and then summoned his vizier, a learned, wise and sensible man, with a knowledge of affairs. When he came into the king’s presence, the king said to him: ‘I am going to tell you what I want to do. It has struck me that I should go out alone tonight and investigate the secret of this pool and of these fish. I want you to sit at the entrance of my tent and to tell the emirs, viziers, chamberlains and deputies, as well as everyone who asks about me, that I am unwell and that you have my instructions not to allow anyone to come in to see me. Don’t tell anyone what I am planning to do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The vizier was in no position to disobey and so the king changed his clothes and strapped on his sword. He climbed down from one of the mountains and walked on for the rest of the night until morning. He spent all the next day walking in the intense heat, and carried on for a second night until morning. At that point, he was pleased to see something black in the distance, and he said to himself: ‘Perhaps I shall find someone to tell me about the pool and the fish.’ When he went nearer he found a palace made of black stones plated with iron, one leaf of whose gate was open and the other shut. Joyfully he stood by the door and knocked lightly; on hearing no reply, he knocked a second and a third time, and when there was still no answer, he knocked more loudly. When no one answered, he was sure that the palace must be empty and so, plucking up his courage, he went through the gate to the passage that led from it, and called out: ‘People of the palace, here is a passing stranger. Have you any food?’\n",
      "\n",
      "He repeated this a second and a third time, and when there was still no reply, emboldened and heartened, he went through the passage to the centre of the palace. This was furnished with silks, starry tapestries and other hangings, but there was no one there. In the centre was an open space, leading to four halls. There was a stone bench, and one hall next to another, then an ornate fountain and four lions of red gold, from whose mouths water poured, glittering like pearls or gems. Round and about were birds and over the top of the palace there was a net of gold that kept them from flying away, but the king was astonished and saddened that he had not seen anyone whom he could ask about the plain, the pool, the fish, the mountains and the palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was sitting between the doors, sunk in thought, when suddenly he heard a plaintive sound coming from a sorrowful heart, with a voice chanting these verses:\n",
      "\n",
      "I try to hide what I suffer at your hands, but this is clear,\n",
      "\n",
      "With my eyes exchanging sleep for sleeplessness.\n",

      "When the king heard this lament, he got up and, following the sound, he found a curtain lowered over the door of a room. He lifted it and behind it he found a handsome young man, well made, eloquent, with a bright face, ruddy cheeks and a mole on his cheek like a disc of amber. He was seated on a couch raised one cubit from the ground and he fitted the poet’s description:\n",

He was showing signs of grief, but when the king greeted him, he replied with the utmost courtesy: ‘Your dignity deserves that I should rise for you, but I have an excuse for not doing so.’ ‘I excuse you, young man,’ said the king. ‘I am your guest and I am also here on an important errand. I want you to tell me about the pool, the fish, this palace, the reason why you are here alone and why you are weeping.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When the young man heard this, tears coursed down his cheeks and he wept bitterly until his breast was drenched. He then recited:\n",

      "Say to the one to whom Time grants sleep,\n",
      "\n",
      "How often misfortunes subside only to rise up!\n",

      "The king, filled with wonder, asked the youth why he was weeping. ‘How can I not shed tears,’ he replied, ‘when I am in this state?’ and he reached down to the skirts of his robe and raised it. It could then be seen that the lower half of his body, down to his feet, was of stone, while from his navel to the hair of his head he was human. When he saw this condition of his, the king was filled with grief and regret. He exclaimed in sorrow: ‘Young man, you have added another care to my cares! I was looking for information about the fish, but now I see I must ask both about them and about you.’ He went on to recite the formula: ‘There is no power and no strength except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent,’ and added: ‘Tell me at once what your story is.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Listen and look,’ said the young man. ‘My ears and eyes are ready,’ replied the king, and the young man continued: ‘There is a marvellous tale attached to the fish and to me, which, were it written with needles on the corners of the eyes, would be a lesson for all who can learn.’ ‘How is that?’ asked the king, AND THE YOUNG MAN REPLIED:\n",

      "You must know that my father was the ruler of this city. His name was Mahmud and he was the king of the Black Islands and of these four mountains. He died after a reign of seventy years and I succeeded him on the throne. I married my cousin, who loved me so deeply that, if I left her, she would neither eat nor drink until my return. She stayed with me for five years but then one day she went in the evening to the baths. I told the cook to prepare a quick supper for me and then I came to these apartments and lay down to sleep in our usual place, telling the slave girls to sit, one at my head and one at my feet. I was disturbed because of my wife’s absence, and although my eyes were shut, I could not sleep and I was still alert.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that I heard the slave girl who was sitting at my head saying to her companion: ‘Mas‘uda, how unfortunate our master is and how miserable are the days of his youth! What damage he suffers at the hands of that damned harlot, our mistress!’ ‘Yes,’ answered the other, ‘may God curse treacherous adulteresses. A man like our master is too young to satisfy this whore, who every night sleeps outside the palace.’ The girl at my head said: ‘Our master is dumb and deluded in that he never asks questions about her.’ ‘Do you think that he knows about her and that she does this with his consent?’ exclaimed the other, adding: ‘She prepares him a drink that he takes every night before he goes to sleep and in it she puts a sleeping drug. He knows nothing about what happens or where she goes. After she has given him the drink, she puts on her clothes, perfumes herself and goes out, leaving him till dawn. Then she comes back to him and burns something under his nose so that he wakes from his sleep.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard what the girls were saying, the light became darkness in my eyes, although I could not believe that night had come. Then my wife returned from the baths; our table was spread and we ate, after which we sat for a time talking, as usual. Then she called for my evening drink and when she had given me the cup which she had poured out, I tipped the contents into my pocket, while pretending to be drinking it as usual. I lay down immediately and, pretending to be asleep, I heard her saying: ‘Sleep through the night and never get up. By God, I loathe you and I loathe your appearance. I am tired of living with you and I don’t know when God is going to take your life.’ She then got up, put on her most splendid clothes, perfumed herself and, taking my sword, she strapped it on and went out through the palace gates, while for my part I got up and followed her out. She made her way through the markets until she reached the city gate. She spoke some words that I could not understand, at which the bolts fell and the gate opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife went out, without realizing that I was following her, and passed between the mounds until she came to a hut with a brick dome. As she went in through its door, I climbed on to the roof and looked down to see her enter and go up to a black slave. One of his lips looked like a pot lid and the other like the sole of a shoe – a lip that could pick up sand from the top of a pebble. The slave was lying on cane stalks; he was leprous and covered in rags and tatters. As my wife kissed the ground before him, he raised his head and said: ‘Damn you, why have you been so slow? My black cousins were here drinking, and each left with a girl, but because of you I didn’t want to drink.’ She said: ‘My master, my darling, delight of my eyes, don’t you know that I am married to my cousin, whose appearance I hate and whose company I loathe? Were it not that I am afraid for you, I would not let the sun rise before the city had been left desolate, echoing to the screeches of owls and the cawing of crows, the haunt of foxes and wolves, and I would move its stones to behind Mount Qaf.’ ‘You are lying, damn you,’ said the black man. ‘I swear by the chivalry of the blacks – and don’t think that our chivalry is like that of the whites – that if you are as late as this once more, I will never again keep company with you or join my body to yours. You are playing fast and loose with me. Am I here just to serve your lust, you stinking bitch, vilest of the whites?’\n",
      "\n",
      "As I looked on and listened to what they were saying, the world turned black for me and I didn’t know where I was. My wife was standing weeping, humbling herself before the slave and saying: ‘My darling, fruit of my heart, if you are angry with me, who will save me, and if you throw me out, who will shelter me, my darling and light of my eyes?’ She went on weeping and imploring him until, to her delight, she managed to conciliate him. She then got up and took off all her clothes. ‘My master,’ she said, ‘is there anything for your servant to eat?’ ‘Lift the pan cover,’ he said. ‘There are some cooked rat bones beneath it that you can eat, and you can then go to this jar and drink the remains of the beer there.’\n",
      "\n",
      "After my wife had eaten and drunk, she washed her hands and her mouth before lying down naked on the cane stalks with the slave, and getting in with him beneath the rags and tatters. When I saw what she had done, I lost control of myself and, climbing down from the top of the roof, I drew the sword that I had brought with me, intending to kill them both. First I struck the neck of the slave, and thought that he was dead…\n",

      "I pronounced the Name of God and called on Him with supplication. Then, gripping the cracks in the rock, I gradually managed to climb up. At that point, by God’s permission, the wind died down and He helped me to make my way in safety until I reached the summit, where the only path that I could take led to the dome. I went in and then performed the ritual ablution as well as two rak‘as in gratitude to God for bringing me to safety, after which I fell asleep under its shelter. In my sleep, I heard a voice saying: ‘Ibn Khadib, when you wake, dig beneath your feet and you will find a bow of brass with three lead arrows, on which are inscribed talismans. Take the bow and the arrows and shoot the rider on top of the dome, for in this way you will rescue people from great distress. When you shoot him, he will fall into the sea and the bow will drop at your feet. Take it and bury it where you found it, and when you do this the sea will swell higher and higher, until it comes level with the mountain top. A little boat will then come up in which will be a man of brass – but not the one whom you shot. He will come to you with an oar in his hand and you must board his boat, but you are not to pronounce the Name of Almighty God. The man will row you for ten days and bring you to the Sea of Safety, where you will find someone to take you back to your own land, but all this will happen only if you do not mention the Name of God.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I awoke, I got up eagerly and did what the voice had told me. I shot the horseman and when he fell into the sea, the bow dropped at my feet and I took it and buried it. The sea then stirred and rose higher until it was level with me on the mountain, and before I had waited long, I saw a little boat making its way towards me, at which I called down praises on Almighty God. When it arrived, I found in it a man of brass with a lead tablet on his breast, inscribed with names and talismans. I boarded it silently, without speaking, and the brass sailor rowed day after day for the full ten days. Then, looking out, to my great joy, I saw the Islands of Safety. Because of the intensity of my joy, I invoked the Name of God, reciting the formula: ‘There is no god but God,’ and crying: ‘Allahu akbar!’ As soon as I did this, the boat tipped me into the sea and then itself overturned.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew how to swim, however, and so I swam all that day until nightfall, by which time my arms could no longer support me and my shoulders were tired. Exhausted and in mortal danger, I recited the confession of faith, being sure that I was about to die. A violent wind stirred up the sea and I was carried on by a wave as big as a castle, which hurled me on to the land in accordance with God’s will. I climbed up on the shore, where I squeezed out my wet clothes, spreading them out on the ground to dry overnight. The next morning, I put them on and went to see where I could walk. I came to a valley, only to discover, after walking round the edge of it, that I was on a small island surrounded by sea. ‘Every time that I escape from one predicament,’ I said to myself, ‘I fall into another that is worse.’\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was thinking over my plight and wishing that I was dead, at a distance I caught sight of a ship with people on it which was making for my island. I got up and sat in a tree, and from there I saw that the ship had come to land, and out of it emerged ten black slaves, each carrying a spade. They walked to the centre of the island where they dug until they had uncovered a trapdoor, which they raised up. They then went back to the ship and returned with bread, flour, butter, honey, sheep and utensils that someone living in the underground chamber would need. The slaves kept on going to and fro from the ship until they had moved all its cargo to the chamber. They then came back bringing the very finest of clothes and in the middle of them was a very old man, a skeletal figure, crushed by Time and worn away. He was wearing a tattered blue robe through which the winds blew west and east, as the poet has said:\n",

      "They walked on, lady, until they reached the underground chamber and went down into it. They stayed out of sight for an hour or more, and then the slaves and the old man came up, but the youth was not with them. They closed the door of the chamber as it had been before, after which they got into the boat and sailed out of sight. I climbed down from my tree and walked to the pile of earth, where I excavated the soil, removed it and worked patiently until I had cleared it all away. There was the trapdoor, made of wood and as big as a millstone. When I lifted it, I could see under it, to my astonishment, a vaulted stone staircase. Down this I went until I reached the bottom and there I found a clean chamber furnished with rugs and silks in which the youth was sitting on a raised dais, leaning back against a round cushion, holding a fan in his hand, with nosegays and scented herbs set before him. He was alone and when he saw me, he turned pale. I greeted him and said: ‘Calm yourself; don’t be alarmed. I mean you no harm. I am a mortal like you, and the son of a king, who has been brought to you by fate to cheer you in your loneliness. What is your story and how is it that you come to be living alone underground?’\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was sure that I was a man like himself, his colour returned and he let me approach him. Then he said: ‘My brother, my story is a strange one. My father is a merchant jeweller, who engages in trade, with slaves, black and white, acting for him, sailing to the furthest of lands with his goods, travelling with camels and carrying vast stores of wealth. He had never had a son, but then in a dream he saw that, although he would have one, this son would be short-lived. He woke in the morning after his dream, crying and weeping, and it was on the following night that my mother conceived me, a date that my father noted. When the period of her pregnancy ended, she gave birth to me, to his delight. He gave banquets and fed the mendicants and the poor because, so near the end of his life, he had been granted this gift. Then he summoned all the astrologers and astronomers, the sages and those who could cast a horoscope. They investigated my horoscope and told my father: “Your son will live for fifteen years, after which he will be faced by a danger, but if he escapes, his life will be a long one. The cause of his death will be as follows. In the Sea of Destruction is the Magnetic Mountain on top of which stands a horse of brass with a rider on whose chest is a lead tablet. Fifty days after this rider falls from his horse, your son will die, killed by the man who shoots the rider, his name being ‘Ajib ibn Khadib.” This caused my father great distress, but he gave me the best of upbringings until I reached the age of fifteen. Then, ten days ago, he heard that the rider had fallen into the sea and that the name of the man who had shot him was ‘Ajib, son of King Khadib. In his fear lest I be killed, my father brought me here. This is my story and this is why I am here all alone.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard this, I was astonished and I said to myself: ‘I was the man who shot the rider, but by God I shall never kill this youth.’ Speaking aloud, I said: ‘Master, may you be preserved from disease and destruction, and if God Almighty wills it, you shall not see care, sorrow or confusion. I shall sit with you and serve you and then, having kept company with you throughout this period, I shall go on my way and you can take me to some of your mamluks, with whom I can travel back to my own lands.’ I sat talking to him until nightfall, when I got up, set light to a large candle and lit the lamps. After having brought out some food, we sat down to a meal, and we then ate some sweetmeats which I had produced. We sat talking until most of the night had passed, when the youth went to sleep. I put a covering over him and settled down to sleep myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, I got up, heated some water and gently woke my companion. When he was awake, I brought him the hot water and he washed his face and thanked me. ‘By God,’ he said, ‘when I am free from my present danger and safe from ‘Ajib ibn Khadib, I shall ask my father to reward you, but if I die, may my blessing be on you even so.’ I replied: ‘May there never be a day on which evil strikes you and may God will it that the day of my death comes before yours.’ I produced some food and we ate and I got him to perfume himself with incense. Then I made a draughts board for him and, after eating some sweetmeats, he and I started to play, going on until nightfall, when I got up, lit the lamps and brought out some more food. I sat talking to him until only a little was left of the night, when he fell asleep, after which I covered him up and slept myself. I went on doing this for a period of days and nights, becoming fond of him and forgetting my cares. ‘The astrologers lied,’ I said to myself, ‘for by God I shall never kill this boy.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I continued to serve him, to act as his companion and to talk with him for thirty-nine days until the night of the fortieth day. The youth was full of gladness and said to me: ‘Thanks be to God, my brother, Who has saved me from death, and this is because of your blessing and the blessing brought by your arrival. I pray that God may restore you to your own land.’ He then asked me to heat him water for a bath, which I willingly agreed to do. I warmed up a great quantity of water and brought it to him. He had a good bath, using lupin flour,* and I helped by rubbing him down and bringing him a change of clothes, after which I made up a high couch for him. He came and lay down to sleep there after his bath, saying: ‘Brother, cut me up a melon and dissolve some sugar in its juice.’ I went to the store cupboard and found a fine melon, which I put on a plate. ‘Master,’ I said to him, ‘do you have a knife?’ ‘It is on this high shelf above my head,’ he replied. So I got up quickly, took the knife and drew it from its sheath, but as I went back, I tripped. With the knife in my hand, I fell on top of the youth and, in accordance with the eternal decree, it quickly penetrated his heart and he died on the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this happened and I realized that I had killed him, I uttered a loud cry, beat my face and tore my clothes, saying: ‘To God we belong and to Him do we return. O Muslims, this handsome youth had only a single night left of the dangerous period of forty days that the astrologers and sages had predicted for him, and his death came at my hands. How I wish I had not tried to cut this melon. This is an agonizing disaster, but it came about in order that God’s decree might be fulfilled.’\n",

      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that the caliph ordered their story to be written down in the records and placed in the royal archives. He then asked the first girl: ‘Have you any news of the jinn lady who bewitched your sisters?’ ‘Commander of the Faithful,’ she replied, ‘she gave me a lock of her hair and told me that when I wanted her I should burn a single hair and she would come quickly, even if she were on the far side of Mount Qaf.’ The caliph asked her to produce the lock of hair, which she did, and he then took a single strand and burned it. When the smell of the burning spread, the palace was rocked by a tremor; there was a sound like a peal of thunder and there stood the lady. As she was a Muslim, she greeted the caliph, who replied: ‘Peace be on you and the mercy and blessings of God.’ ‘Know,’ she went on, ‘that this girl sowed the seed of gratitude for a good deed that she did me, for which I could not repay her, when she saved me from death and killed my enemy. I then saw what her sisters had done to her. At first I wanted to kill them but I was afraid that this might distress her, so then I thought that I should take revenge by turning them by magic into dogs. If you now want them to be set free, Commander of the Faithful, I shall release them as a favour to you and to her, for I am a Muslim.’ ‘Do so,’ he said, ‘and after that I shall begin to investigate the affair of the girl who was beaten. If it turns out that she was telling the truth, we shall avenge her on whoever wronged her.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Commander of the Faithful,’ said the lady, ‘I shall release the two and then tell you who it was who wronged this girl and seized her wealth – someone who is your closest relation.’ She then took a bowl of water, cast a spell over it and recited some unintelligible words. She sprinkled water on the faces of the two bitches and said: ‘Return to your former shapes as humans,’ which they did. ‘Commander of the Faithful,’ she then said, ‘the young man who beat the girl is your own son, al-Amin, the brother of al-Ma’mun. He had heard of her great beauty and set a trap for her. But he married her legally and was within his rights to beat her, as he had imposed a condition on her and got her to swear a solemn oath that she would do nothing to break it. Break it she did, however, and he was going to kill her, but for fear of God he beat her instead and sent her back to her own house. This is the story of the second girl, but God knows better.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When the caliph heard what she had to say and learned how the girl had come to be beaten, he was filled with astonishment and said: ‘Glory be to God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent, Who has granted me the favour of learning this girl’s history and rescued these two others from sorcery and torture. By God, I shall do something that will be recorded after me.’ Then he had his son al-Amin brought before him and he questioned him about the second girl, questions to which al-Amin returned a truthful answer. He then brought in qadis and notaries, as well as the three dervishes, together with the first girl and her two sisters who had been bewitched. He married the three of them to the three dervishes, who had told him that they were kings, and whom he now appointed as chamberlains at his court, giving them all they needed and assigning them allowances, as well as lodgings in the palace of Baghdad. He returned the girl who had been beaten to his son al-Amin, renewing their marriage contract, giving her a great store of wealth and ordering that their house should be rebuilt with the greatest splendour. He himself married the housekeeper and slept with her that night and in the morning he gave her a chamber of her own among his concubines, together with slave girls to serve her and regular allowances. The people were astonished at his magnanimity, generosity and wisdom. His orders were that all these stories should be written down.\n",

      "When the caliph heard what the man was reciting, he said to Ja‘far: ‘Look at this man and note his verses, which show that he is in need.’ The caliph then went up to the man and said: ‘Shaikh, what is your craft?’ ‘I am a fisherman,’ he replied. ‘I left home at midday, but up till now God has not provided me with anything with which I can feed my family. I am tired of life and I wish that I were dead.’ ‘Would you go back with us to the Tigris, stand on the bank and trust in my luck as you cast your net. Whatever comes up I will buy for a hundred dinars.’ When he heard this, the old man agreed with delight. He went with the three of them back to the river, cast his net and waited before pulling in the cord and dragging it in. Up it came with a heavy, locked chest. The caliph looked at the chest, handled it and noted its weight, after which he gave the fisherman his hundred dinars, and the man went off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The caliph himself then left, accompanied by Masrur, who was carrying the chest, and they brought it up to the palace. Candles were lit and after the chest had been placed in front of the caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur came forward and broke it open. In it they found a basket of palm leaves sewn up with threads of red wool, and after they had cut this open, they found a carpet. When they had lifted this out, they discovered a shawl and wrapped in this was a girl like a silver ingot, who had been killed and cut in pieces – a sight that so distressed the caliph that his tears flowed over his cheeks. He turned to Ja‘far and said: ‘Dog of a vizier, are people to be murdered and thrown into the river during my reign, so that I am to be held responsible for them on the Day of Judgement? By God, I must make the murderer pay for this girl’s death and I shall put him to the most cruel of deaths.’ He then told Ja‘far in his furious rage: ‘It is as true as is my descent from the ‘Abbasid caliphs that if you do not produce the murderer for my justice, I will hang you at the palace gate together with forty of your cousins.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Before leaving his presence, Ja‘far asked for a three-day delay, which the caliph granted. He then went down sadly into the city, saying to himself: ‘How can I find out who killed this girl and bring him to the caliph? If I bring the wrong person, I shall be held responsible for him. I don’t know what to do.’ For three days, he sat at home and on the fourth the caliph sent a chamberlain to fetch him. When he came to the caliph and was asked where the murderer was, he said: ‘Commander of the Faithful, am I the monitor of murder victims that I should know who killed the girl?’ The caliph was enraged and gave orders that he should be hanged below the palace. A town crier was ordered to call out in the streets of Baghdad: ‘Whoever wants to see the hanging of Ja‘far the Barmecide, the caliph’s vizier, and the hanging of his Barmecide cousins at the palace gate, let him come to watch.’ People came out from all quarters of the city to see the execution, although they did not know why the Barmecides were being hanged. The gallows were set up and the victims were made to stand beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioners were waiting for the agreed signal from the caliph and the crowd was weeping for Ja‘far and his cousins. At this point, however, out came a young man – handsome, well dressed, with a face bright as the moon, dark eyes, radiant forehead, red cheeks and a mole like a disc of ambergris. He cleared a way for himself through the people and kept on until he stood before Ja‘far. ‘Lord of the emirs and shelterer of the poor,’ he said, ‘you are saved from this plight. The killer of the murdered girl whom you found in the chest is I, so hang me in retaliation for her death and take revenge for her on me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Ja‘far heard this, he was glad that he himself had escaped death, but he felt sorry for the young man. While they were talking, an old man, stricken in years, made his way through the crowd until he reached the two of them. He greeted them and said: ‘My lord, great vizier, don’t believe what this young man says. No one but I killed the girl, so avenge her death on me; if you do not, I will demand justice from you in the presence of Almighty God.’ ‘Vizier,’ said the youth, ‘this is the maundering of an old man who doesn’t know what he is saying. It was I and I alone who killed her, so make me pay for her death.’ ‘My son,’ said the old man, ‘you are young and this world is still attractive to you, while I am old and have had my fill of it. I shall give my life to ransom you and I shall ransom the vizier and his cousins, for I killed the girl and I conjure you by God to hang me quickly, as there is no life for me now that she is dead.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The vizier was astonished to see what was happening and he took the young man and the old one to the caliph. He kissed the ground and said: ‘Commander of the Faithful, I have brought you the murderer of the girl.’ ‘Which is he?’ asked the caliph. ‘This young man says that he killed her, while the old man here says that that is a lie and that he himself is the killer. Here are the two of them before you.’ The caliph looked at them and asked: ‘Which of you did kill her?’ ‘I did,’ said the young man. ‘I am the killer,’ protested the old man. ‘Take the two of them,’ said the caliph to Ja‘far, ‘and hang them both.’ ‘If only one of them killed her,’ said Ja‘far, ‘then to hang the other would be unjust.’ The young man insisted: ‘By the truth of the One God Who raised up the heavens and spread out the earth, it was I who killed her and this was how she was killed.’ He described what the caliph had found, which made him sure that the young man was indeed the murderer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Filled with wonder at what the two had said, the caliph asked the young man: ‘Why was it that you unjustly killed this girl and what led you to confess to the murder without being beaten? Why did you come yourself just now to tell me to avenge her on you?’ THE YOUNG MAN REPLIED:\n",
      "\n",
      "You must know, Commander of the Faithful, that this girl was my cousin and my wife, while this old man is her father and my uncle. I married her when she was a virgin and God gave me three sons by her. She used to love me and wait on me and I saw no fault in her, while I for my part loved her dearly. At the beginning of this month, she fell seriously ill, but I brought her doctors and gradually she got better. I wanted to take her to the baths but she said that before going, there was something that she wanted for which she had been longing. I said that I would willingly get it and asked what it was. ‘I have a longing for an apple,’ she said, ‘that I can smell and from which I can take a bite.’ I went straight away to the city and searched for apples, but I couldn’t find a single one to buy, even for a dinar. I went back home in distress and told my wife of my failure. This upset her; she had been weak before, and that night she became much weaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent the night brooding over the problem and when morning came, I left my house and did the rounds of the orchards, one after the other, without finding any apples in them. Then I met an old gardener and, when I asked him, he told me: ‘There are few or no apples to be found, except in Basra, in the orchard of the Commander of the Faithful, where they are in the charge of his gardener who keeps them for his master.’ I went back home and my love and affection for my wife led me to make myself ready to set out on a journey to Basra. I travelled for fifteen days and nights there and back, bringing my wife three apples which I had bought from the gardener at Basra for one dinar each. I went in and gave them to her, but they gave her no pleasure and she put them aside. Her weakness and fever had grown worse and this went on for ten days, after which she recovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then left my house and went to my shop, where I sat buying and selling. At midday, while I was sitting there, a black slave passed by holding one of those three apples in his hand and playing with it. When I asked him about the apple, pretending that I wanted to get one like it, he laughed and told me that he had got it from his mistress. ‘I had been away,’ he explained, ‘and when I got back, I found her sick. She had three apples with her and she told me that her cuckold of a husband had gone to Basra for them and had bought them for three dinars. It was one of these that I took.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard what the slave had to say, Commander of the Faithful, the world turned black for me. I got up, closed my shop and returned home, out of my mind with anger. Looking at the apples, I could see only two. ‘Where is the third?’ I asked my wife, and when she said: ‘I don’t know,’ I was certain that the slave had told me the truth, so I picked up a knife, and coming from behind her, without a word I knelt on her breast and slit her throat with the knife. Then I cut off her head and quickly put her in a basket, covering her with a shawl. I wrapped her in a piece of carpet, sewed the whole thing up and put it in a chest, which I locked. I then loaded it on to my mule and threw it with my own hands into the Tigris. In God’s Name, Commander of the Faithful, I implore you to hang me quickly, as I am afraid that my wife will demand restitution from me on the Day of Judgement. For when I had thrown her into the river without anyone knowing what I had done, I went back home and there I found my eldest son in tears, although he did not know what I had done to his mother. When I asked him why he was crying, he told me that he had taken one of his mother’s apples and had gone into the lane to play with his brothers. He said: ‘But a tall black slave snatched it from me and asked me where I had got it. I told him that my father had gone to Basra to bring it for my mother who was sick and that he had bought three apples for three dinars. The slave took the apple and paid no attention to me, even though I told him this a second and a third time, and then he hit me and went off with it. I was afraid that my mother would beat me because of it and so my brothers and I went off out of the city. Evening came and I was still afraid of what she might do to me. For God’s sake, father, don’t say anything to her that may make her ill again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard what the boy had to say, I realized that this slave was the one who had made up a lying story to hurt my wife and I was certain that I had killed her unjustly. While I was weeping bitterly, this old man, her father, arrived and, when I told him what had happened, he sat down beside me and wept. We went on weeping until midnight, and for five days until now we have been mourning her and regretting her unjust death. All the blame for this rests on the slave and it is he who is responsible for her death. I implore you, by your ancestors’ honour, to kill me quickly, as there is no life for me now she is dead. So avenge her death on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the caliph heard the young man’s story, he was filled with astonishment and said: ‘By God, I shall hang no one except this damned slave and I shall do a deed which will cure the sick and please the Glorious King.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.\n",
      "16 \t 0.454 \t Then, when it was the eighth night, SHE CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that THE YOUNG MAN SAID:\n",
      "\n",
      "I struck the slave with the intention of cutting off his head but I had failed to sever his jugular and only cut his gullet, skin and flesh. He let out a loud snort and as my wife stirred, I stepped back, returned the sword to its sheath and went back to the city, where I entered the palace and lay down on my bed until morning. There was my wife coming to wake me, with her hair shorn, wearing mourning. She said: ‘Cousin, don’t object to what I am doing, as I have had news that my mother has died and that my father has been killed fighting the infidels, while one of my brothers has died of a fatal sting and the other of a fall. It is right for me to weep and grieve.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard this, I did not tell her what I knew but said: ‘Do what you think proper and I shall not oppose you.’ From the beginning to the end of a whole year she remained miserable and in mourning, and then she said to me: ‘I want you to build me a tomb shaped like a dome beside your palace, which I shall set aside for grief and call the House of Sorrows.’ ‘Do as you please,’ I said, and she built her House of Sorrows, over which was a dome, covering what looked like a tomb. She brought the slave there and installed him in it, but he could no longer be of any service to her. He went on drinking wine, but since the day that I had wounded him he could no longer speak, and he was alive only because his allotted span had not yet come to an end. Every day, morning and evening, my wife would go to the tomb weeping and lamenting for him, and she would give him wine and broth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things went on like this until it came to the second year. I had been long-suffering and had paid no attention to her, until one day, when I came to her room unexpectedly, I found her exclaiming tearfully: ‘Why are you absent from my sight, my heart’s delight? Talk to me, O my soul; speak to me, my darling.’ She recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have found consolation, love has left me no endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart loves none but you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take my bones and my soul with you wherever you may go,\n",
      "\n",
      "And where you halt, bury me opposite you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Call out my name over my grave and my bones will moan in answer,\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing the echo of your voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "My wishes are fulfilled on the day I am near you,\n",
      "\n",
      "While the day of my doom is when you turn from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I may pass the night in fear, threatened with destruction,\n",
      "\n",
      "But union with you is sweeter to me than safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next she recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If every blessing and all this world were mine,\n",
      "\n",
      "Together with the empire of the Persian kings,\n",
      "\n",
      "To me this would not be worth a gnat’s wing,\n",
      "\n",
      "If my eyes could not look on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had finished speaking and weeping, I said to her: ‘Cousin, that is enough of sorrow, and more weeping will do you no good.’ ‘Do not try to stop me doing what I must do,’ she said, ‘for in that case, I shall kill myself.’ I said no more and left her to do what she wanted, and she went on grieving, weeping and mourning for a second year and then a third. One day, I went to her when something had put me out of temper and I was tired of the violence of her distress. I found her going towards the tomb beneath the dome, saying: ‘Master, I hear no word from you. Master, why don’t you answer me?’ Then she recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Grave, grave, have the beloved’s beauties faded?\n",
      "\n",
      "And has the brightness and the radiance gone?\n",
      "\n",
      "Grave, you are neither earth nor heaven for me,\n",
      "\n",
      "So how is it you hold both sun and moon?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard what she said and the lines she recited, I became even angrier than before and I exclaimed: ‘How long will this sorrow last?’ Then I recited myself:\n",
      "\n",
      "Grave, grave, has his blackness faded?\n",
      "\n",
      "And has the brightness and the foulness failed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Grave, you are neither basin nor a pot,\n",
      "\n",
      "So how is it you hold charcoal and slime?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When she heard this, she jumped up and said: ‘Damn you, you dog. It was you who did this to me and wounded my heart’s darling. You have caused me pain and robbed him of his youth, so that for three years he has been neither dead nor alive.’ To which I replied: ‘Dirty whore, filthiest of the fornicators and the prostitutes of black slaves, yes, it was I who did that.’ Then I drew my sword and aimed a deadly blow at her, but when she heard what I said and saw that I was intending to kill her, she burst out laughing and said: ‘Off, you dog! What is past cannot return and the dead cannot rise again, but God has given the man who did this to me into my power. Because of him there has been an unquenchable fire in my heart and a flame that cannot be hidden.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as she stood there, she spoke some unintelligible words and added: ‘Through my magic become half stone and half man.’ It was then that I became as you see me now, unable to stand or to sit, neither dead nor alive. After this, she cast a spell over the whole city, together with its markets and its gardens. It had contained four different groups, Muslims, Christians, Jews and Magians, and these she transformed into fish – the white fish being the Muslims, the red the Magians, the blue the Christians and the yellow the Jews – and she transformed the four islands into four mountains that surround the pool. Every day she tortures me by giving me a hundred lashes with her whip until the blood flows down over my shoulders. Then she dresses me in a hair shirt of the kind that I am wearing on my upper half, over which she places this splendid gown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man then wept and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "O my God, I must endure Your judgement and decree,\n",
      "\n",
      "And if that pleases You, I shall do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tyrants have wronged me and oppressed me here,\n",
      "\n",
      "But Paradise may be my recompense.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sufferings have left me in sad straits,\n",
      "\n",
      "But God’s choice as His favoured Prophet intercedes for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The king then turned to the youth and said: ‘Although you have freed me from one worry, you have added another to my cares. Where is the woman and where is the tomb with the wounded slave?’ ‘He is lying in his tomb beneath the dome,’ said the young man, ‘and she is in that chamber opposite the door. She comes out once each day at sunrise, and the first thing she does is to strip me and give me a hundred lashes. I weep and call out but I cannot move to defend myself, and after she has tortured me, she takes wine and broth to the slave. She will come early tomorrow.’ ‘By God, young man,’ said the king, ‘I shall do you a service for which I shall be remembered and which will be recorded until the end of time.’ He then sat talking to him until nightfall, when they both slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Close to dawn the king rose, stripped off his clothes, drew his sword and went to where the slave lay, surrounded by candles, lamps, perfumes and unguents. He came up to the slave and killed him with one blow, before lifting him on to his back and throwing him down a well in the palace. After that, he wrapped himself in the slave’s clothes and lay down in the tomb with the naked sword by his side. After an hour, the damned sorceress arrived, but before she entered the tomb, she first stripped her cousin of his clothes, took a whip and beat him. He cried out in pain: ‘The state that I am in is punishment enough for me, cousin; have pity on me.’ ‘Did you have pity on me,’ she asked, ‘and did you leave me, my beloved?’ She beat him until she was tired and the blood flowed down his sides; then she dressed him in a hair shirt under his robe, and went off to carry the slave a cup of wine and a bowl of broth.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the tomb she wept and wailed, saying: ‘Master, speak to me; master, talk to me.’ She then recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "How long will you turn away, treating me roughly?\n",
      "\n",
      "Have I not shed tears enough for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you intend abandoning me?\n",
      "\n",
      "If your object is the envious, their envy has been cured.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shedding tears, she repeated: ‘Master, talk to me.’ The king lowered his voice, twisted his tongue, and speaking in the accent of the blacks, he said: ‘Oh, oh, there is no might and no power except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent!’ When she heard this, she cried out with joy and then fainted. When she had recovered, she said: ‘Master, is this true?’ The king, in a weak voice, said: ‘You damned woman, do you deserve that anyone should talk to you or speak with you?’ ‘Why is that?’ she asked. ‘Because all day long you torture your husband, although he cries for help, and from dusk to dawn he stops me from sleeping as he calls out his entreaties, cursing both me and you. He disturbs me and harms me, and but for this I would have been cured. It is this that keeps me from answering you.’ ‘With your permission,’ she replied, ‘I shall release him.’ ‘Do that,’ said the king, ‘and allow me to rest.’ ‘I hear and obey,’ she replied and, after going from the tomb to the palace, she took a bowl, filled it with water and spoke some words over it. As the water boiled and bubbled, like a pot boiling on the fire, she sprinkled her husband with it and said: ‘I conjure you by the words that I have recited, if you are in this state because of my magic, revert from this shape to what you were before.’\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden shudder ran through the young man and he rose to his feet, overjoyed at his release, calling out: ‘I bear witness that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Apostle of God – may God bless him and give him peace.’ His wife shouted at him, saying: ‘Go, and don’t come back, or else I shall kill you!’ He left her and she went back to the tomb, where she said: ‘Master, come out to me, so that I may see your beautiful form.’ In a weak voice the king replied: ‘What have you done? You have brought me relief from the branch but not from the root.’ ‘My beloved, my black darling,’ she said, ‘what is the root?’ ‘Curse you, you damned woman!’ he replied. ‘It is the people of the city and of the four islands. Every night at midnight the fish raise their heads asking for help and cursing me and you. It is this that stops my recovery. Go and free them quickly and then come back, take my hand and help me to get up, for I am on the road to recovery.’\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing these words and thinking that he was the slave, the sorceress was delighted and promised in God’s Name willingly to obey his command. She got up and ran joyfully to the pool, from which she took a little water…\n",

      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.\n",
      "3 \t 0.445 \t When it was the fourth night, Dunyazad asked her to finish the story, if she was not sleepy, and so she went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that when the fisherman told the ‘ifrit that he would not believe him until he saw this with his own eyes, a shudder ran through the ‘ifrit and he became a cloud of smoke hovering over the sea. Then the smoke coalesced and entered the jar bit by bit until it was all there. Quickly the fisherman picked up the brass stopper with its inscription and put it over the mouth of the bottle. He called out to the ‘ifrit: ‘Ask me how you want to die. By God, I am going to throw you into the sea and then build myself a house in this place so that I can stop anyone who comes fishing by telling them that there is an ‘ifrit here who gives anyone who brings him up a choice of how he wants to be killed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ‘ifrit heard this and found himself imprisoned in the bottle, he tried to get out but could not, as he was prevented by Solomon’s seal, and he realized that the fisherman had tricked him. ‘I was only joking,’ he told the fisherman, who replied: ‘You are lying, you most despicable, foulest and most insignificant of ‘ifrits,’ and he took up the bottle. ‘No, no,’ called the ‘ifrit, but the fisherman said: ‘Yes, yes,’ at which the ‘ifrit asked him mildly and humbly what he intended to do with him. ‘I am going to throw you into the sea,’ the fisherman told him. ‘You may have been there for eighteen hundred years, but I shall see to it that you stay there until the Last Trump. Didn’t I say: “Spare me, may God spare you, and do not kill me lest God place you in the power of one who will kill you”? But you refused and acted treacherously towards me. Now God has put you in my power and I shall do the same to you.’ ‘Open the bottle,’ implored the ‘ifrit, ‘so that I can do you good.’ ‘Damned liar,’ said the fisherman. ‘You and I are like the vizier of King Yunan and Duban the sage.’ ‘What is their story?’ asked the ‘ifrit, AND THE FISHERMAN REPLIED:\n",
      "\n",
      "You must know, ‘ifrit, that once upon a time in the old days in the land of Ruman there was a king called Yunan in the city of Fars. He was a wealthy and dignified man with troops and guards of all races, but he was also a leper, who had taken medicines of various kinds and used ointments, but whose illness doctors and men of learning had been unable to cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an elderly physician known as Duban the sage, who had studied the books of the Greeks, the Persians, the Arabs and the Syrians. He was a master of medicine and of astronomy and was conversant with the fundamental principles of his subject, with a knowledge of what was useful and what was harmful. He knew the herbs and plants that were hurtful and those that were helpful, as well as having a mastery of philosophy, together with all branches of medicine and other sciences. When this man arrived at the city, within a few days he had heard that the king was suffering from leprosy and that no doctor or man of learning had been able to cure him. He spent the night thinking over the problem, and when dawn broke he put on his most splendid clothes and went to the king, kissing the ground before him and calling eloquently for the continuance of his glory and good fortune. After introducing himself, he went on: ‘I have heard, your majesty, of the disease that has afflicted you and that, although you have been treated by many doctors, they have been unable to remove it. I shall cure you without giving you any medicine to drink or applying any ointments.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Yunan was amazed to hear what he had to say and asked how he was going to do that, promising to enrich him and his children’s children. ‘I shall shower favours on you,’ he said, ‘and grant you all your wishes, taking you as a boon companion and a dear friend.’ He then presented Duban with a robe of honour and treated him with favour, before asking: ‘Are you really going to cure my leprosy without medicines or ointment?’ Duban repeated that he would and the astonished king asked when this would be, urging him to be quick. ‘To hear is to obey,’ replied Duban, promising to do this the very next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duban now went to the city, where he rented a house in which he deposited his books, his medicines and his drugs. He took some of the latter and placed them in a polo stick, for which he made a handle, and he used his skill to design a ball. The next day, after he had finished, he went into the presence of the king, kissed the ground before him, and told him to ride out to the polo ground and play a game. The king was accompanied by the emirs, chamberlains, viziers and officers of state, and before he had taken his seat on the ground, Duban came up to him and handed him the stick. ‘Take this,’ he said. ‘Hold it like this and when you ride on to the field, hit the ball with a full swing until the palm of your hand begins to sweat, together with the rest of your body. The drug will then enter through your palm and spread through the rest of you. When you have finished and the drug has penetrated, go back to your palace, wash in the baths and then go to sleep, for you will have been cured. That is all.’\n",
      "\n",
      "At that, the king took the stick from him and mounted, holding it in his hand. He threw the ball ahead of him and rode after it, hitting it as hard as he could when he caught up with it, and then following it up and hitting it again until the palm of his hand and the rest of his body became sweaty because of his grip on the stick. When Duban saw that the drug had penetrated into the king’s body, he told him to go back to his palace and bathe immediately. The king went back straight away and ordered that the baths be cleared for him. This was done, and house boys and mamluks hurried up to him and prepared clothes for him to wear. He then entered the baths, washed himself thoroughly and dressed before coming out, after which he rode back to his palace and fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much for him, but as for Duban the sage, he returned to spend the night in his house, and in the morning he went to ask permission to see the king. On being allowed to enter, he went in, kissed the ground before him and addressed him with these verses which he chanted:\n",
      "\n",
      "Virtues are exalted when you are called their father,\n",
      "\n",
      "A title that none other may accept.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brightness shining from your face removes\n",
      "\n",
      "The gloom that shrouds each grave affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "This face of yours will never cease to gleam,\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the face of Time may frown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your liberality has granted me the gifts\n",
      "\n",
      "That rain clouds shower down on the hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your generosity has destroyed your wealth,\n",
      "\n",
      "Until you reached the heights at which you aimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Duban had finished these lines, the king stood up and embraced him, before seating him by his side and presenting him with splendid robes of honour. This was because when he had left the baths he had looked at his body and found it, to his great delight and relief, pure and silver white, showing no trace of leprosy. In the morning, he had gone to his court and taken his seat on his royal throne, the chamberlains and officers of state all standing up for him, and it was then that Duban had come in. The king had risen quickly for him, and after the sage had been seated by his side, splendid tables of food were set out and he ate with the king and kept him company for the rest of the day. The king then made him a present of two thousand dinars, in addition to the robes of honour and other gifts, after which he mounted him on his own horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duban went back to his house, leaving the king filled with admiration for what he had done and saying: ‘This man treated me externally without using any ointment. By God, that is skill of a high order! He deserves gifts and favours and I shall always treat him as a friend and companion.’ The king passed a happy night, gladdened by the soundness of his body and his freedom from disease. The next day, he went out and sat on his throne, while his state officials stood and the emirs and viziers took their seats on his right and his left. He asked for Duban, who entered and kissed the ground before him, at which the king got up, greeted him, seated him by his side and ate with him. He then presented him with more robes of honour as well as gifts, and talked with him until nightfall, when he gave him another five robes of honour together with a thousand dinars, after which Duban went gratefully home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, the king came to his court, where he was surrounded by his emirs, viziers and chamberlains. Among the viziers was an ugly and ill-omened man, base, miserly and so envious that he was in love with envy. When this man saw that the king had taken Duban as an intimate and had rewarded him with favours, he was jealous and planned to do him an injury. For, as the sayings have it: ‘No one is free of envy’ and ‘Injustice lurks in the soul; strength shows it and weakness hides it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "This vizier came up to King Yunan, kissed the ground before him and said: ‘King of the age, I have grown up surrounded by your bounty and I have some serious advice for you. Were I to conceal it from you, I would show myself to be a bastard, but if you tell me to give it to you, I shall do so.’ Yunan was disturbed by this and said: ‘What is this advice of yours?’ The vizier replied: ‘Great king, it was a saying of the ancients that Time was no friend to those who did not look at the consequences of their actions. I have observed that your majesty has wrongly shown favour to an enemy who is looking to destroy your kingdom. You have treated this man with generosity and done him the greatest honour, taking him as an intimate, something that fills me with apprehension.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Yunan was uneasy; his colour changed and he asked the vizier who he was talking about. ‘If you are asleep, wake up,’ the vizier told him, and went on: ‘I am talking about the sage Duban.’ ‘Damn you!’ exclaimed Yunan. ‘This is my friend and the dearest of people to me, for he cured me through something that I held in my hand from a disease that no other doctor could treat. His like is not to be found in this age or in this world, from west to east. You may accuse him, but today I am going to assign him pay and allowances, with a monthly income of a thousand dinars, while even if I divided my kingdom with him, this would be too little. I think that it is envy that has made you say this, reminding me of the story of King Sindbad.’\n",

      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that the girl laughed in spite of her anger. She then went up to the men and said: ‘Tell me about yourselves, for you have no more than one hour to live, and were you not people of rank, leaders or governors among your peoples, you would not have been so daring.’ ‘Damn you, Ja‘far,’ the caliph said. ‘Tell her about us or else we shall be killed by mistake, and speak softly to her before we become victims of misfortune.’ ‘That is part of what you deserve,’ replied Ja‘far, but the caliph shouted at him: ‘There is a time for joking, but now is when we must be serious.’ The lady then went to the dervishes and asked them whether they were brothers. ‘No, by God,’ they said, ‘we are only faqirs and foreigners.’ She next asked one of them whether he had been born one-eyed. ‘No, by God,’ he said, ‘but I have a strange and wonderful story about the loss of my eye, which, were it written with needles on the inner corners of the eyeballs, would serve as a warning to those who take heed.’ The second and the third dervish, when asked, made the same reply, and they then said: ‘By God, lady, each of us comes from a different country and each is the son of a king and is a ruler over lands and subjects.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned to them and said: ‘Each of you is to tell his story and explain why he came here and he can then touch his forelock and go on his way.’ The first to come forward was the porter, who said: ‘Lady, I am a porter and this girl, who bought you your provisions, told me to carry them from the wine seller to the fruiterer, from the fruiterer to the butcher, from the butcher to the grocer, from the grocer to the sweetmeat seller and the perfumer, and then here. You know what happened to me with you. This is my story, and that’s all there is.’ The girl laughed and said: ‘Touch your forelock and go.’ ‘By God,’ he said, ‘I am not going to leave until I have heard the stories of my companions.’ THE FIRST DERVISH THEN CAME FORWARD AND SAID:\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady, know that the reason why my chin is shaven and my eye has been plucked out is that my father was a king, who had a brother, also a king, who reigned in another city. His son and I were born on the same day. Years later, when we had grown up, I had got into the habit of visiting my uncle every so often, and I would stay with him for some months. My cousin treated me with the greatest generosity, and would kill sheep for me and pour out wine that he strained for me. Once, when we were sitting drinking and were both under the influence of the wine, he said to me: ‘Cousin, there is something that I need from you. Please don’t refuse to do what I want.’ ‘I shall obey you with pleasure,’ I said. After binding me with the most solemn of oaths, he got up straight away and left for a short while. Back he came then with a lady, veiled, perfumed and wearing the most expensive of clothes, who stood behind him as he turned to me and said: ‘Take this woman and go ahead of me to such-and-such a cemetery’ – a place that I recognized from his description. ‘Take her to the burial enclosure and wait for me there.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the oath that I had sworn, I could not disobey him or refuse his request and so I went off with the woman and we both went into the enclosure. While we were sitting there, my cousin arrived with a bowl of water, a bag containing plaster, and a carpenter’s axe. Taking this axe, he went to a tomb in the middle of the enclosure and started to open it up, moving its stones to one side. Then he used the axe to prod about in the soil of the tomb until he uncovered an iron cover the size of a small door. He raised this, revealing beneath it a vaulted staircase. Turning to the woman, he said: ‘Now you can do what you have chosen to do,’ at which she went down the stairs. My cousin then looked at me and said: ‘In order to complete the favour that you are doing me, when I go down there myself, I ask you to put back the cover and to replace the soil on top of it as it was before. Use the mortar that is in this bag and the water in the bowl to make a paste and coat the circle of the stones in the enclosure so that it looks as it did before, without anyone being able to say: “The inner part is old but there is a new opening here.” I have been working on this for a full year and no one but God knows what I have been doing. This is what I need from you.’ He then took his leave of me, wishing me well, and went down the stairs. When he was out of sight, I got up and replaced the cover and followed his instructions, so that the place looked just as it had before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then went back like a drunken man to the palace of my uncle, who was away hunting. In the morning, after a night’s sleep, I thought of what had happened to my cousin the evening before and, when repentance was of no use, I repented of what I had done and of how I had obeyed him. Thinking that it might have been a dream, I started to ask after my cousin, but nobody could tell me where he was. I went out to the cemetery, looking for the enclosure, but I could not find it. I kept on going round enclosure after enclosure and grave after grave until nightfall, but I still failed in my search. I returned to the palace, but I could neither eat nor drink, for my thoughts were taken up with my cousin, as I did not know how he was, and I was intensely distressed. I passed a troubled night until morning came, when I went for a second time to the cemetery, thinking over what my cousin had done and regretting that I had listened to him. I went round all the enclosures but, to my regret, I still could not find the right one or recognize the grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "For seven days I went on with my fruitless quest, and my misgivings increased until I was almost driven mad. The only relief I could find was to leave and go back to my father, but as soon as I reached the gate of his city, I was attacked by a group of men who tied me up. I was astonished, seeing that I was the son of the city’s ruler and they were my father’s servants, and in my alarm I said to myself: ‘What can have happened to my father?’ I asked my captors why they were doing this. At first they did not answer, but after a time one of them, who had been a servant of mine, said: ‘Your father has fallen victim to the treachery of Time. The army conspired against him and he was killed by the vizier, who has taken his place. It was on his orders that we were watching out for you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I was stunned by what I heard about my father and fearful because I had a long-standing quarrel with the vizier, before whom my captors now brought me. I had been passionately fond of shooting with a pellet bow and the quarrel arose from this. One day when I was standing on the roof of my palace, a bird settled on the roof of the palace of the vizier. I intended to shoot it, but the pellet missed and, as had been decreed by fate, it struck out the eye of the vizier. This was like the proverb expressed in the old lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked with a pace that was decreed for us,\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is how those under fate’s control must walk.\n",

      "A man destined to die in a certain land\n",
      "\n",
      "Will not find death in any other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the vizier lost his eye, he could not say anything because my father was the king of the city, and this was why he was my enemy. When I now stood before him with my hands tied, he ordered my head to be cut off. ‘For what crime do you kill me?’ I asked. ‘What crime is greater than this?’ he replied, pointing to his missing eye. ‘I did that by accident,’ I protested. ‘If you did it by accident,’ he replied, ‘I am doing this deliberately.’ Then he said: ‘Bring him forward.’ The guards brought me up in front of him, and sticking his finger into my right eye, the vizier plucked it out, leaving me from that time on one-eyed, as you can see. Then he had me tied up and put in a box, telling the executioner: ‘Take charge of him; draw your sword and when you have brought him outside the city, kill him and let the birds and beasts eat him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioner took me out of the city to the middle of the desert and then he removed me from the box, bound as I was, hand and foot. He was about to bandage my eyes before going on to kill me, but I wept so bitterly that I moved him to tears. Then, looking at him, I recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought of you as a strong coat of mail\n",
      "\n",
      "To guard me from the arrows of my foes,\n",
      "\n",
      "But you are now the arrow head.\n",
      "\n",

      "At least your silence neither hurts me nor helps them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also other lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought my brothers were a coat of mail;\n",
      "\n",
      "They were, but this was for the enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought of them as deadly shafts;\n",

      "They were, but their points pierced my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioner had been in my father’s service and I had done him favours, so when he heard these lines, he said: ‘Master, what can I do? I am a slave under command.’ But then he added: ‘Keep your life, but don’t come back to this land or else you will be killed and you will destroy me, together with yourself.

      "I kissed his hands, scarcely believing that I had escaped death, in comparison with which I found the loss of my eye insignificant. So I travelled to my uncle’s city and, after presenting myself to him, I told him what had happened to my father, as well as how I had come to lose my eye. He burst into tears and said: ‘You have added to my cares and my sorrows. For your cousin disappeared days ago and I don’t know what has happened to him, nor can anyone bring me news.’ He continued to weep until he fainted and I was bitterly sorry for him. He then wanted to apply some medicaments to my eye, but when he saw that it was like an empty walnut shell, he said: ‘Better to lose your eye, my boy, than to lose your life.’\n",
      "\n",
      "At that, I could no longer stay silent about the affair of my cousin, his son, and so I told him all that had happened. When he heard my news, he was delighted and told me to come and show him the enclosure. ‘By God, uncle,’ I said, ‘I don’t know where it is. I went back a number of times after that and searched, but I couldn’t find the place.’ Then, however, he and I went to the cemetery and, after looking right and left, to our great joy I recognized the place. The two of us went into the enclosure and, after removing the earth, we lifted the cover. We climbed down fifty steps and when we had reached the bottom, we were met by blinding smoke. ‘There is no might and no power except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent,’ exclaimed my uncle – words that can never put to shame anyone who speaks them. We walked on and found ourselves in a hall filled with flour, grain, eatables and so on, and there in the middle of it we saw a curtain hanging down over a couch. My uncle looked and found his son and the woman who had gone down with him locked in an embrace, but they had become black charcoal, as though they had been thrown into a pit of fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "On seeing this, my uncle spat in his son’s face and said: ‘You deserve this, you pig. This is your punishment in this world, but there remains the punishment of the next world, which will be harsher and stronger.’ Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that King Yunan accused his vizier of being jealous of Duban and wanting to have him killed. ‘Then after that I would regret it,’ Yunan added, ‘as King Sindbad regretted killing his falcon.’ ‘Excuse me, your majesty,’ said the vizier, ‘but how was that?’ YUNAN WENT ON:\n",
      "\n",
      "You must know that there was a Persian king with a passion for enjoyment and amusement, who had a fondness for hunting. He had reared a falcon which was his constant companion by night and by day, and which would spend the night perched on his wrist. He would take it hunting with him and he had a golden bowl made for it which he hung round its neck and from which it could drink. One day the chief falconer came to where he was sitting and told him that it was time to go out hunting. The king gave the orders and went off with the falcon on his wrist until he and his party reached a wadi, where they spread out their hunting cordon. Trapped in this was a gazelle and the king threatened that anyone who allowed it to leap over his head would be put to death. When the cordon was narrowed, the gazelle came to where the king was posted, supported itself on its hindlegs and placed its forelegs on its chest as though it was kissing the ground before him. He bent his head towards it and it then jumped over him, making for the open country. He noticed that his men were looking at him and winking at each other and when he asked his vizier what this meant, the man explained: ‘They are pointing out that you said that if anyone let the gazelle jump over his head, he would be killed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The king then swore that he would hunt it down and he rode off in pursuit, following the gazelle until he came to a mountain. There it was about to pass through a cleft when the king loosed his falcon at it and the bird clawed at its eyes, blinding and dazing it, so that the king could draw his mace and knock it over with a single blow. He then dismounted and cut its throat, after which he skinned it and tied it to his saddlebow. As this was in the noonday heat and the region was desolate and waterless, both the king and his horse were thirsty by now. The king scouted round and discovered a tree from which what looked like liquid butter was dripping. Wearing a pair of kid gloves, he took the bowl from the falcon’s neck, filled it with this liquid and set it in front of the bird, but it knocked the bowl and overturned it. The king took it and filled it again, thinking that the falcon must be thirsty, but the same thing happened when he put it down a second time. This annoyed him and he went a third time to fill the bowl and take it to his horse, but this time the falcon upset it with its wing. The king cursed it, exclaiming: ‘You unluckiest of birds, you have stopped me drinking, and have stopped yourself and the horse.’ He then struck off its wing with a blow from his sword, but the bird raised its head as though to say by its gesture: ‘Look at the top of the tree.’ The king raised his eyes and what he saw there was a brood of vipers whose poison was dripping down. Immediately regretting what he had done, he mounted his horse and rode back to his pavilion, bringing with him the gazelle, which he handed to the cook, telling him to take it and roast it. As he sat on his chair with the falcon on his wrist, it drew its last breath and died, leaving its master to exclaim with sorrow for having killed it, when it had saved his life. So ends the story of King Sindbad.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Great king,’ the vizier said, ‘Sindbad acted out of necessity and I can see nothing wrong in that. I myself am acting out of sympathy for you, so that you may realize that I am right, for otherwise you may meet the same fate as the vizier who schemed against the prince.’ ‘How was that?’ the king asked, AND THE VIZIER SAID:\n",
      "\n",
      "You must know, your majesty, that there was a vizier in the service of a certain king with a son who was passionately fond of hunting. This vizier had been ordered to accompany the prince wherever he went, and so, when he went off to hunt one day, the vizier rode with him. While they were riding they caught sight of a huge beast and the vizier encouraged the prince to pursue it. The prince rode after it until he was out of sight and the beast then vanished into the desert, leaving the prince with no idea of where to go. Just then, ahead of him he saw a weeping girl and when he asked her who she was, she told him: ‘I am the daughter of one of the kings of India and while I was in this desert I became drowsy. Then, before I knew what was happening, I had fallen off my beast and was left alone, not knowing what to do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When the prince heard this, he felt sorry for the girl and took her up behind him on the back of his horse. On his way, he passed a ruined building and the girl said she wanted to relieve herself. He set her down, but she was taking so long that he followed her, only to discover that, although he had not realized it, she was a female ghul and was telling her children: ‘I have brought you a fat young man today.’ ‘Fetch him to us, mother,’ they said, ‘so that we can swallow him down.’ On hearing this, the prince shuddered, fearing for his life and certain that he was going to die. He went back and the ghula came out and, seeing him panic-stricken and shivering, she asked why he was afraid. ‘I have an enemy whom I fear,’ he told her. ‘You call yourself a prince?’ she asked, and when he said yes, she went on: ‘Why don’t you buy him off with money?’ ‘He won’t accept money but wants my life,’ he told her, adding: ‘I am afraid of him and I have been wronged.’ ‘In that case, if what you say is true, then ask help from God,’ she said, ‘for He will protect you against your enemy’s evil and the evil that you fear from him.’ At that the prince lifted his head towards heaven and said: ‘God Who answers the prayers of those in distress when they call on You, and Who clears away evil, may You help me against my enemy and remove him from me, for You have power to do what You wish.’\n",
      "\n",
      "After hearing the prince’s prayer, the ghula left him. He went back to his father and when he told him about the vizier’s advice, his father summoned the man and had him killed. As for you, your majesty, if you put your trust in this sage, he will see to it that you die the worst of deaths, and it will be the man whom you have well treated and taken as a friend who will destroy you. Don’t you see that he cured your disease externally through something you held in your hand, so how can you be sure that he won’t kill you by something else you hold?\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What you say is right, vizier, my sound advisor,’ agreed the king, ‘for this man has come as a spy to destroy me and if he could cure me with something I held, it may be that he can kill me with something that I smell.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he asked the vizier what was to be done about Duban. The vizier said: ‘Send for him immediately, telling him to come here, and when he does, cut off his head and then you will be safe from any harm he may intend to do you. Betray him before he betrays you.’ The king agreed with the vizier, and sent for Duban, who came gladly, not knowing what God the Merciful had ordained. This was as the poet said:\n",

      "The king asked him: ‘Do you know why I have sent for you?’ ‘No one knows what is hidden except for God,’ Duban replied. ‘I have sent for you,’ said the king, ‘in order to kill you and take your life.’ This astonished Duban, who said: ‘Why should you kill me, your majesty, and what is my crime?’ ‘I have been told that you are a spy,’ answered the king, ‘and that you have come to murder me. I am going to kill you before you can do the same to me.’ The king then called for the executioner and said: ‘Cut off this traitor’s head, so that we may be freed from his evil-doing.’ ‘Spare me,’ said Duban, ‘and God will spare you; do not kill me, lest He kill you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He then repeated what I repeated to you, ‘ifrit, but you would not give up your intention to kill me. Similarly, the king insisted: ‘I shall not be safe unless I put you to death.

      "Then he said to the king: ‘If this is how you reward me, it is the crocodile’s reward.’ The king asked for the story of the crocodile, but Duban replied: ‘I cannot tell it to you while I am in this state. I conjure you by God to spare me so that God may spare you.’ At that one of the king’s courtiers got up and asked the king for Duban’s life, pointing out: ‘We have not seen that he has done you any wrong, but only that he cured you of a disease that no wise doctor was able to treat.’ The king said: ‘You do not know why I have ordered his death, but this is because, if I spare him, I shall certainly die. A man who cured me of my illness by something that I held in my hand is able to kill me by something that I smell. I am afraid that he has been bribed to murder me, as he is a spy and this is why he has come here. He must be executed, and after that I shall be safe.’\n",

      "Duban repeated his plea for mercy, but on realizing that he could not escape execution, he said to the king: ‘If I must be killed, allow me a delay so that I may return to my house, give instructions to my family and my neighbours about my funeral, settle my debts and give away my books of medicine. I have a very special book which I shall present to you to be kept in your treasury.’ ‘What is in the book?’ asked the king. ‘Innumerable secrets,’ Duban replied, ‘the least of which is that, if you cut off my head and then open three pages and read three lines from the left-hand page, my head will speak to you and answer all your questions.’ The astonished king trembled with joy. ‘When I cut off your head, will you really talk to me?’ he asked. ‘Yes,’ said Duban. ‘This is an amazing thing!’ exclaimed the king, and he sent him off under escort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duban returned to his house and settled all his affairs, and then the next day he came back to the court, where all the viziers, chamberlains, deputies and officers of state assembled, until the place looked like a garden in flower. He entered and was brought before the king, carrying with him an old book together with a collyrium case containing powder. He sat down and asked for a plate, which was brought. He then poured the powder on it and spread it out, after which he said: ‘King, take this book, but don’t open it until you cut off my head. When you have done that, set the head on the plate and have it pressed into the powder. At that, the flow of blood will halt and you can then open the book.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The king took the book from him and gave orders for his execution. The executioner cut off his head, which fell on the plate, where it was pressed down into the powder. The blood ceased to flow and Duban the wise opened his eyes and said: ‘O king, open the book.’ The king did this, but he found the pages stuck together, so he put his finger into his mouth, wet it with his spittle, and with difficulty he opened the first, the second and the third pages. He opened six pages in all, but when he looked at them, he could find nothing written there. ‘Wise man,’ he said, ‘there is no writing here.’ ‘Open more pages,’ said Duban. The king opened three more, but soon afterwards he felt the poison with which the book had been impregnated spreading through him. He was wracked by convulsions and cried out that he had been poisoned, while Duban recited:\n",

      "As soon as Duban’s head had finished speaking, the king fell dead. Know then, ‘ifrit, that had he spared Duban, God would have spared him, but as he refused and looked to have him killed, God destroyed him. Had you spared me, God would have spared you…\n",

For his part, the merchant went and thanked the old men, who congratulated him on his safety, after which each of them went home. This, however, is not more surprising than the tale of the fisherman.’ When the king asked what that was, she went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that there once was a poor, elderly fisherman with a wife and three children, who was in the habit of casting his net exactly four times each day. He went out to the shore at noon one day, put down his basket, tucked up his shirt, waded into the sea and cast his net. He waited until it had sunk down before pulling its cords together and then, finding it heavy, he tried unsuccessfully to drag it in. He took one end of it to the shore and fixed it to a peg that he drove in there, after which he stripped and dived into the sea beside it, where he continued tugging until he managed to get it up. He climbed out delightedly, put his clothes back on and went up to the net, only to find that what was in it was a dead donkey, and that the donkey had made a hole in the net. The fisherman was saddened by this and recited the formula: ‘There is no might and no power except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent,’ before saying: ‘This is a strange thing that God has given me by way of food!’ and then reciting:\n",

Thinking that it must be full of fish, he fastened it to his peg, stripped off his clothes and dived in to free it.

      "The fisherman stripped off his clothes and, after diving in, he worked his hardest to drag the net to shore. Then, when he opened it up, he found in it a brass bottle with a lead seal, imprinted with the inscription of our master Solomon, the son of David, on both of whom be peace. The fisherman was delighted to see this, telling himself that it would fetch ten gold dinars if he sold it in the brass market. He shook it and, discovering that it was heavy as well as sealed, he said to himself: ‘I wonder what is in it? I’ll open it up and have a look before selling it.’ He took out a knife and worked on the lead until he had removed it from the bottle, which he then put down on the ground, shaking it in order to pour out its contents. To his astonishment, at first nothing came out, but then there emerged smoke which towered up into the sky and spread over the surface of the ground. When it had all come out, it collected and solidified; a tremor ran through it and it became an ‘ifrit with his head in the clouds and his feet on the earth. His head was like a dome, his hands were like winnowing forks and his feet like ships’ masts. He had a mouth like a cave with teeth like rocks, while his nostrils were like jugs and his eyes like lamps. He was dark and scowling.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he saw this ‘ifrit the fisherman shuddered; his teeth chattered; his mouth dried up and he could not see where he was going. At the sight of him the ‘ifrit exclaimed: ‘There is no god but the God of Solomon, His prophet. Prophet of God, do not kill me for I shall never disobey you again in word or in deed.’ ‘‘Ifrit,’ the fisherman said, ‘you talk of Solomon, the prophet of God, but Solomon died eighteen hundred years ago and we are living in the last age of the world. What is your story and how did you come to be in this bottle?’ To which the ‘ifrit replied: ‘There is no god but God. I have good news for you, fisherman.’ ‘What is that?’ the fisherman asked, and the ‘ifrit said: ‘I am now going to put you to the worst of deaths.’ ‘For this good news, leader of the ‘ifrits,’ exclaimed the fisherman, ‘you deserve that God’s protection be removed from you, you damned creature. Why should you kill me and what have I done to deserve this? It was I who saved you from the bottom of the sea and brought you ashore.’\n",
      "\n",
      "But the ‘ifrit said: ‘Choose what death you want and how you want me to kill you.’ ‘What have I done wrong,’ asked the fisherman, ‘and why are you punishing me?’ The ‘ifrit replied: ‘Listen to my story,’ and the fisherman said: ‘Tell it, but keep it short as I am at my last gasp.’ ‘Know, fisherman,’ the ‘ifrit told him, ‘that I was one of the apostate jinn, and that together with Sakhr, the jinni, I rebelled against Solomon, the son of David, on both of whom be peace. Solomon sent his vizier, Asaf, to fetch me to him under duress, and I was forced to go with him in a state of humiliation to stand before Solomon. “I take refuge with God!” exclaimed Solomon when he saw me, and he then offered me conversion to the Faith and proposed that I enter his service. When I refused, he called for this bottle, in which he imprisoned me, sealing it with lead and imprinting on it the Greatest Name of God. Then, at his command, the jinn carried me off and threw me into the middle of the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘For a hundred years I stayed there, promising myself that I would give whoever freed me enough wealth to last him for ever, but the years passed and no one rescued me. For the next hundred years I told myself that I would open up all the treasures of the earth for my rescuer, but still no one rescued me. Four hundred years later, I promised that I would grant three wishes, but when I still remained imprisoned, I became furiously angry and said to myself that I would kill whoever saved me, giving him a choice of how he wanted to die. It is you who are my rescuer, and so I allow you this choice.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When the fisherman heard this, he exclaimed in wonder at his bad luck in freeing the ‘ifrit now, and he went on: ‘Spare me, may God spare you, and do not kill me lest God place you in the power of one who will kill you.’ ‘I must kill you,’ insisted the ‘ifrit, ‘and so choose how you want to die.’ Ignoring this, the fisherman made another appeal, calling on the ‘ifrit to show gratitude for his release. ‘It is only because you freed me that I am going to kill you,’ repeated the ‘ifrit, at which the fisherman said: ‘Lord of the ‘ifrits, I have done you good and you are repaying me with evil. The proverbial lines are right where they say:\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Don’t go on so long,’ said the ‘ifrit when he heard this, ‘for death is coming to you.’ The fisherman said to himself: ‘This is a jinni and I am a human. God has given me sound intelligence which I can use to find a way of destroying him, whereas he can only use vicious cunning.’ So he asked: ‘Are you definitely going to kill me?’ and when the ‘ifrit confirmed this, he said: ‘I conjure you by the Greatest Name inscribed on the seal of Solomon and ask you to give me a truthful answer to a question that I have.’ ‘I shall,’ replied the ‘ifrit, who had been shaken and disturbed by the mention of the Greatest Name, and he went on: ‘Ask your question but be brief.’ The fisherman went on: ‘You say you were in this bottle, but there is not room in it for your hand or your foot, much less all the rest of you.’ ‘You don’t believe that I was in it?’ asked the ‘ifrit, to which the fisherman replied: ‘I shall never believe it until I see it with my own eyes.’\n",

      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.\n",
      "0 \t 0.419 \t Then, when it was the sixth night, her sister, Dunyazad, told her to finish the story and Shahrazad said: ‘If the king permits me.’ ‘Go on,’ he replied, AND SHE CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that the fisherman told the ‘ifrit: ‘Had you spared me, I would have spared you, but you wanted nothing but my death and so now I am going to destroy you by throwing you into the sea here, imprisoned in this bottle.’ The ‘ifrit cried out: ‘I implore you, in God’s Name, fisherman, don’t do this! Spare me and don’t punish me for what I did. If I treated you badly, do you for your part treat me well, as the proverb says: “You who do good to the evil-doer, know that what he has done is punishment enough for him.” Do not do what ‘Umama did to ‘Atika!’ ‘What was that?’ asked the fisherman, but the ‘ifrit said: ‘I cannot talk while I am imprisoned, but if you let me out, I shall tell you the story.’ The fisherman said: ‘Stop talking like this, for I shall certainly throw you into the sea and I am never going to release you. I pleaded with you and begged you, but all you wanted to do was to kill me, although I had done nothing at all to deserve this and, far from doing you any harm, I had helped you by freeing you from your prison. When you did that to me, I realized that you were an evil-doer. Be sure that, when I throw you into the sea, if anyone brings you out, I will tell him what you did to me and warn him, so that he may throw you back again and there you will stay until the end of time or until you perish.’ ‘Free me,’ pleaded the ‘ifrit. ‘This is a time for generosity and I promise you that I shall never act against you again but will help you by making you rich.’\n",
      "\n",
      "At this, the fisherman made the ‘ifrit promise that were he freed, far from hurting his rescuer, he would help him. When the fisherman was sure of this and had made the ‘ifrit swear by the greatest Name of God, he opened the bottle and the smoke rose up, until it had all come out and had formed into a hideous shape. The ‘ifrit then picked the bottle up and hurled it into the sea, convincing the watching fisherman that he was going to be killed. The man soiled his trousers, crying: ‘This is not a good sign!’ but then his courage came back and he said: ‘God Almighty has said: “Fulfil your promise, for your promise will be questioned.”* You gave me your word, swearing that you would not act treacherously to me, as otherwise God will do the same to you, for He is a jealous God Who bides His time but does not forget. I say to you what Duban the wise said to King Yunan: “Spare me and God will spare you.” ’\n",
      "\n",
      "The ‘ifrit laughed and told the fisherman to follow him as he walked ahead. This the fisherman did, scarcely believing that he was safe. The pair of them left the city, climbed a mountain and then went down into a wide plain. There they saw a pool, and after the ‘ifrit had waded into the middle of it, he asked the fisherman to follow him, which he did. When the ‘ifrit stopped, he told the fisherman to cast his net, and the man was astonished to see that the pond contained coloured fish – white, red, blue and yellow. He took out his net, cast it and when he drew it in he found four fish, each a different colour. He was delighted by this, and the ‘ifrit said: ‘Present these to the sultan and he will enrich you. Then I ask you in God’s Name to excuse me, since at this time I know no other way to help you. I have been in the sea for eighteen hundred years and this is the first time that I have seen the face of the land.’ After advising the fisherman not to fish the pool more than once a day, he took his leave, speaking words of farewell. Then he stamped his foot on the earth and a crack appeared into which he was swallowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fisherman returned to the city, full of wonder at his encounter. He took the fish to his house, where he brought out an earthenware bowl, filled it with water and put them in it. As they wriggled about in the water, he placed the bowl on his head and went to the palace as the ‘ifrit had told him. When he came to the king and presented him with the fish, the king was astonished, for never in his life had he seen anything like them. He gave orders that they were to be handed over to a slave girl who was acting as cook but whose skill had not yet been tested, as she had been given him three days earlier by the king of Rum. The vizier told her to fry the fish, adding that the king had said that he was testing her only in the hour of need, and that he was putting his hopes in her artistry and cooking skills, for the fish had been given him as a present.\n",
      "\n",
      "After issuing these instructions, the vizier went back to the king, who told him to hand the fisherman four hundred dinars. After he had passed over the money, the man stowed it inside his clothes and set off back home at a run, falling, getting up and then stumbling again, thinking that this was all a dream. He bought what was needed for his family and then returned to his wife in joy and delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much for him, but as for the slave girl, she took the fish and cleaned them. Then, after setting the frying pan on the fire, she put the fish in it and when one side was properly cooked, she turned them on to the other. All of a sudden, the kitchen wall split open and out came a girl, with a beautiful figure and smooth cheeks, perfect in all her attributes. Her eyes were darkened with kohl and she had on a silken kaffiyeh with a blue fringe. She was wearing earrings; on her wrists were a pair of bracelets, while her fingers were adorned with rings set with precious gems, and in her hand she held a bamboo staff. Thrusting this into the pan, she asked: ‘Fish, are you still faithful to your covenant?’ at which the cook fainted. The girl repeated her question a second and a third time and the fish raised their heads from the pan and said: ‘Yes, yes,’ in clear voices, and then they recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you return, we return;\n",
      "\n",
      "If you keep faith, then so do we,\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you go off, we are quits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At that, the girl turned the pan upside down with her staff and left through the hole from which she had come, after which the wall closed up behind her. The cook recovered from her faint and saw the four fish burned like black charcoal. She exclaimed: ‘His spear was broken on his very first raid!’ and fell unconscious again on the floor. While she was in this confused state, the vizier came and saw that something had gone badly wrong with her, so much so that she could not even tell what day of the week it was. He nudged her with his foot, and when she had recovered her senses, she explained to him, in tears, what had happened. He was astonished, and exclaimed: ‘This is something wonderful!’ He then sent for the fisherman and, when he was brought in, the vizier told him to fetch another four fish like the first ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fisherman went to the pool, cast his net and when he drew it in, there were four fish like the first. He took them to the vizier, who brought them to the cook and said: ‘Fry these in front of me so that I can see what happens.’ The cook got up, prepared the fish, put the pan over the fire and threw them into it. As soon as she did, the wall split open and out came the girl, looking as she had done before, with a staff in her hand. She prodded the pan and asked: ‘Fish, fish, are you true to your old covenant?’ At this, all the fish raised their heads and repeated the lines:\n",

      "\tI have heard, O fortunate king, that a wealthy merchant, who had many dealings throughout the lands, rode out one day to settle a matter of business in one of them. When it became hot, he sat down under a tree and put his hand in his saddlebag, from which he took out a piece of bread and a date. He ate and when he had finished with the date he threw away its stone, at which a huge ‘ifrit appeared, with a drawn sword in his hand. This ‘ifrit came up to the merchant and said: ‘Get up so that I can kill you as you killed my son.’ ‘How did I kill your son?’ asked the merchant, and the ‘ifrit told him: ‘When you ate that date and threw away the stone, it struck my son in the chest as he was walking, and he died instantly.’ ‘We belong to God and to Him do we return,’ recited the merchant, adding: ‘There is no might and no power except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent. If I killed him, this was by accident, so please forgive me.’ ‘I must kill you,’ insisted the ‘ifrit, and he dragged off the merchant, threw him down on the ground and raised his sword to strike.\n",

I shall take a solemn oath and swear by God that I shall come back to you and you can then do what you want with me. God will be the guarantor of this.’ The ‘ifrit trusted him and let him go, after which he went home, settled all his affairs, and gave everyone what was owed them. He told his wife and children what had happened, gave them his injunctions and stayed with them until the end of the year, when he got up, performed the ritual ablution and, with his shroud under his arm, said goodbye to his family and all his relations as well as his neighbours, and set off reluctantly, while they all wept and wailed. He came to the orchard on what was New Year’s Day, and as he sat there weeping over his fate, a very old man approached him, leading a gazelle on a chain. The newcomer greeted him and asked him why he was sitting there alone, when the place was a haunt of jinn. The merchant told the story of his encounter with the ‘ifrit, and the old man exclaimed: ‘By God, brother, you are a very pious man and your story is so wonderful that were it written with needles on the corners of men’s eyes, it would be a lesson for those who take heed.’\n",
      "\tHe took his seat by the merchant’s side and promised not to leave until he had seen what happened to him with the ‘ifrit. As the two of them sat there talking, the merchant was overcome by an access of fear together with ever-increasing distress and apprehension. It was at this point that a second old man arrived, having with him two black Salukis. After greeting the two men, he asked them why they were sitting in this haunt of jinn and they told him the story from beginning to end. No sooner had he sat down with them than a third old man, with a dappled mule, came up, greeted them and asked why they were there, at which they repeated the whole story – but there is no point in going over it again.\n",
      "\tAs soon as the newcomer had sat down, a huge dust-devil appeared in the middle of the desert, clearing away to show the ‘ifrit with a drawn sword in his hand and sparks shooting from his eyes. He came up to the three, dragged the merchant from between them and said: ‘Get up so that I can kill you as you killed my beloved son.’ The merchant sobbed and wept, while the three old men shed tears, wailed and lamented. Then the first of them, the man with the gazelle, left the others, kissed the ‘ifrit’s hand and said: ‘Jinni, royal crown of the jinn, if I tell you the story of my connection with this gazelle, will you grant me a third share in this merchant’s blood?’ The ‘ifrit agreed to do this if he found the story marvellous, AND SO THE OLD MAN BEGAN HIS TALE:\n",
      "\tKnow, ‘ifrit, that this gazelle is my cousin, my own flesh and blood. I married her when she was still young and stayed with her for thirty years without her bearing me a child. So I took a concubine and she bore me a son, the perfection of whose eyes and eyebrows made him look like the full moon when it appears. He grew up and when he was fifteen I had occasion to travel to a certain city, taking with me a great quantity of trade goods. My wife, now this gazelle, had studied sorcery since her youth and she turned the boy into a calf and his mother into a cow, handing them over to the herdsman. When, after a long absence, I got back from my journey, I asked about the two of them and my wife told me that the woman had died and that the boy had run away, where she did not know.\n",
      "\tFor a year I remained sad at heart and tearful until ‘Id al-Adha came round and I sent to tell the herdsman to bring me a fat cow. What he brought me was my slave girl whom my wife had enchanted. I tucked up my clothes, took the knife in my hand and was about to slaughter her, when she gave a cry, howled and shed tears. This astonished me and, feeling pity for her, I left her and told the herdsman to fetch me another. At that my wife called out: ‘Kill this one, as I have no finer or fatter cow.’ I went up again to do the killing and again the cow gave a cry, at which I told the herdsman to slaughter her and then skin her. He did this, only to discover that there was neither flesh nor fat in the carcass, but only skin and bone. I was sorry for what I had done at a time when regret was of no use, and I gave the cow to the herdsman, telling him to bring me a fat calf. He brought me my son, and when this ‘calf ’ caught sight of me, he broke his tether and rolled in the dust in front of me, howling and shedding tears. Again I felt pity and told the herdsman to leave the calf and fetch me a cow, and again my wife, now this gazelle, called to me, insisting that I must slaughter the calf that day. ‘This is a noble and a blessed day,’ she pointed out. ‘The sacrifice must be a good one and we have nothing fatter or finer than this calf.’ ‘Look at what happened with the cow that you told me to kill. This led to a disappointment and we got no good from it at all, leaving me full of regret at having slaughtered it. This time I am not going to do what you say or kill this calf.’ ‘By God the Omnipotent, the Compassionate, the Merciful, you must do this on this noble day, and if you don’t, then you are not my husband and I am not your wife.’ On hearing these harsh words, but not realizing what she intended to do, I went up to the calf with the knife in my hand.\n",

      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say. ‘What a good, pleasant, delightful and sweet story this is!’ exclaimed Dunyazad, at which Shahrazad told her: ‘How can this compare with what I shall tell you this coming night, if I am still alive and the king spares me?’ ‘By God,’ the king said to himself, ‘I am not going to kill her until I hear the rest of the story,’ and so they spent the rest of the time embracing one another until the sun had fully risen. The king then went to his court as the vizier came with the shroud under his arm, and he gave his judgements, appointing some officials and dismissing others, until evening, but to the vizier’s great surprise he gave no instructions about his daughter. The court was then dismissed and King Shahriyar returned to his palace.\n",

      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that the caliph swore that he would hang no one but the slave, as what the young man had done was excusable. Then he turned to Ja‘far and said: ‘Fetch me this damned slave who was responsible for all this, and if you fail, you will take his place.’ Ja‘far went away weeping and saying: ‘Twice I have been threatened with death; the pitcher does not always escape unbroken. There is nothing that I can do about this but hope that He who saved me on the first occasion may save me on the second. By God, I shall not leave my house for three days, and the True God will do what He sees fit.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, he stayed inside for three days and on the fourth he brought in the qadis and the notaries and took a tearful farewell of his children. At that moment, a messenger arrived from the caliph, saying: ‘The Commander of the Faithful is furiously angry and has sent for you, saying that before the day is over you will be hanged.’ When Ja‘far heard that, he wept, as did his children, his slaves and his whole household. When he had finished taking leave of the others, he went up to his youngest daughter, whom he loved more than all his other children, to say goodbye to her. He clasped her to his breast, kissed and wept at parting from her. In her pocket he could feel something round and he asked her what it was. ‘An apple, father,’ she told him, ‘inscribed with the name of our lord, the caliph. Our slave Raihan brought it four days ago and would not give it to me until I paid him two dinars.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Ja‘far heard about the slave and the apple, he was overjoyed. Putting his hand into his daughter’s pocket, he brought out the apple and recognized it, exclaiming: ‘O God, Whose deliverance is near at hand!’ He then ordered the slave to be brought, and when he had come, Ja‘far asked him where he had got the apple. ‘By God, master,’ he replied, ‘if lies can save a man once, truth can save him twice. I didn’t steal it from your palace, from the imperial palace or from the Commander of the Faithful’s orchard. Five days ago, while I was out walking, I went into a lane in the city where I saw some children playing. One of them had this apple and I snatched it away from him and hit him. He cried and told me that it belonged to his sick mother. “She wanted my father to get her an apple,” he told me, “and my father went to Basra and bought her three of them, for which he paid three dinars. I stole one of the three to play with.” I paid no attention to the child’s tears and took the apple and came here. Then my little mistress paid two gold dinars for it. That is my story.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Ja‘far heard this, he was amazed that the mischief involving the death of the girl had been caused by his own slave. He was sorry for his connection with him but delighted at his own escape, reciting these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "When a slave brings disaster on you,\n",
      "\n",
      "Use him as a ransom for your life.\n",

      "But you will never find another life.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Grasping the slave by the hand, he brought him to the caliph and told him his story from beginning to end. The caliph was full of astonishment and laughed until he fell over. He ordered that the story should be written down and spread among the people, but Ja‘far said: ‘Do not wonder at this tale for it is not more astonishing than the story of the vizier Nur al-Din ‘Ali, the Egyptian, and Shams al-Din Muhammad, his brother.’ ‘Tell it to me,’ said the caliph, ‘although what can be more wonderful than the story we have just heard?’ ‘I shall not tell it to you,’ said Ja‘far, ‘unless you promise not to execute my slave.’ ‘If it is really more remarkable than what has just happened, I shall grant you his life, but if not, then I shall have him killed.’ JA‘FAR BEGAN:\n",
      "\n",
      "Know then, Commander of the Faithful, that in the old days there was in Egypt a just and upright sultan who loved the poor and would sit with men of learning. He had an intelligent and experienced vizier, with a knowledge of affairs and of administration. This vizier was a very old man and he had two sons, fair as moons, unequalled in comeliness and beauty. The name of the elder was Shams al-Din Muhammad, while the younger was Nur al-Din ‘Ali. Nur al-Din was more conspicuously graceful and handsome than his brother, so much so that his fame had spread in other lands, and people came to Egypt to see his beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "It then happened that their father died. He was mourned by the sultan, who went to the sons, brought them close to him and gave them robes of honour. ‘Do not be distressed,’ he said, ‘for you will take your father’s place.’ This delighted them and they kissed the ground in front of him. After a month of mourning for their father, they entered into office as joint viziers, sharing between themselves the power that had been in their father’s hands, with one of them accompanying the sultan whenever he went on his travels.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened that the sultan was about to leave on a journey in the morning and it was the turn of the elder brother to go with him. On the night before, the two brothers were talking together and the elder said to the younger: ‘Brother, it is my intention that you and I should marry on the same night.’ ‘Do what you want,’ said his brother, ‘for I agree to your suggestion.’ When they had made this agreement, the elder said: ‘If God so decrees, we shall marry two girls and consummate the marriage on one and the same night. Then they will give birth on the same day and, God willing, your wife will produce a boy and mine a girl. We shall then marry them to each other and they will be husband and wife.’ ‘What dowry will you ask from my son for your daughter?’ asked Nur al-Din. ‘I shall take from your son,’ replied Shams al-Din, ‘three thousand dinars, three orchards and three estates. On no other terms will the marriage contract be valid.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When he heard this, Nur al-Din said: ‘What is this dowry that you want to impose as a condition on my son? Don’t you know that we two are brothers and that both of us, by God’s grace, are joint viziers, equal in rank? You should give your daughter to my son without asking for any dowry at all, and if there must be one, then it should be fixed at something that will merely show people that a payment has been made. You know that the male is better than the female. My son is a male and it is through him and not through your daughter that we shall be remembered.’ ‘What about my daughter, then?’ asked Shams al-Din. ‘It will not be through her that we shall be remembered among the emirs,’ his brother told him, and added: ‘You want to deal with me like the man in the story who approached one of his friends to ask for something. “I swear by the Name of God,” said his friend, “that I shall do what you ask, but tomorrow.” In reply, the other recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If favours are put off until next day,\n",
      "\n",
      "For those who know, that is rejection.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shams al-Din said: ‘I see that you are selling me short and making out that your son is better than my daughter. It is clear that you lack intelligence and have no manners. You talk about our shared vizierate, but I only let you share out of pity for you, so that you might help me as an assistant and I might not cause you disappointment. Now, by God, after what you have said, I shall not marry my daughter to your son, even if you were to pay out her weight in gold.’ Nur al-Din was angry when he heard this and said: ‘I’m no longer willing to marry my son to your daughter.’ ‘And I’m not prepared to accept him as a husband for her,’ repeated Shams al-Din, adding: ‘Were I not going off on a journey I would make an example of you, but when I get back, I shall let you see what my honour requires.’\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing what his brother had to say, Nur al-Din was beside himself with anger, but he managed to conceal this. The two of them spent the night in separate quarters and in the morning the sultan set out on his journey, going by Giza and making for the Pyramids, accompanied by the vizier Shams al-Din. As for Shams al-Din’s brother, Nur al-Din, after spending the night in a furious rage, he got up and performed the morning prayer. Then he went to his strongroom and, taking out a small pair of saddlebags, he filled them with gold. Remembering his brother’s contemptuous remarks, he started to recite these lines:\n",

      "Go, and you will replace the one you leave behind;\n",
      "\n",
      "Work hard, for in this lies life’s pleasure.\n",

      "The stay-at-home is humble, arriving at no goal\n",
      "\n",
      "Except distress, so leave your land and go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see that water left to stand goes bad;\n",
      "\n",
      "If it flows, it is sweet, but if not, it is not.\n",

      "The watcher would not always follow it.\n",

      "Lions that do not leave their lair will find no prey;\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrows not shot from bows can strike no target.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold dust when in the mine is worth no more than earth,\n",
      "\n",
      "And aloes wood in its own land is merely used for fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "When taken from the mine, gold is a precious object of demand,\n",
      "\n",
      "While elsewhere in the world it is outranked by aloes wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Nur al-Din had finished these lines, he told one of his servants to prepare the official mule with its quilted saddle. This beast, coloured like a starling, had a high, dome-like back; its saddle was of gold and its stirrups of Indian steel; its trappings were like those of the Chosroes; and it looked like a bride unveiled. Nur al-Din ordered that a silk carpet and a prayer rug should be put on it, with the saddlebags being placed under the rug. He then told his servants and slaves that he was going on a pleasure trip outside the city. ‘I shall go towards Qalyub,’ he said, ‘and spend three nights away. None of you are to follow me, for I am feeling depressed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He quickly mounted the mule, taking with him only a few provisions, and he then left Cairo, making for open country. By noon he had reached Bilbais, where he dismounted, rested and allowed the mule to rest too. He took and ate some of his provisions, and in Bilbais he bought more food for himself and fodder for his mule. He then set out into the country, and when night fell, he had come to a place called al-Sa‘diya. Here he spent the night, getting out some food, placing the saddlebags beneath his head and spreading out the carpet. He slept there in the desert, still consumed with anger, and after his night’s sleep, he rode off in the morning, urging on his mule until he came to Aleppo. There he stayed for three days in one of the khans, looking around the place at his leisure until both he and the mule were rested. Then he decided to move on and, mounting his mule, he rode out of the city without knowing where he was heading. His journey continued until, without knowing where he was, he reached Basra. He stopped at a khan, unloaded the saddlebags from the mule and spread out the prayer mat. He then handed over the mule with all its gear to the gatekeeper of the khan, asking him to exercise it, which he did.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened that the vizier of Basra was sitting at the window of his palace. He looked at the mule with its costly trappings and thought that it might be a ceremonial beast, the mount of viziers or kings. Perplexed by this, he told one of his servants to bring him the gatekeeper of the city. The servant did as he was told, and the gatekeeper came to him and kissed the ground. The vizier, who was a very old man, asked him who the mule’s owner might be and what he was like. ‘Master,’ said the gatekeeper, ‘the owner of this mule is a very young man of the merchant class, impressive and dignified, with elegant manners, the son of a merchant.’ On hearing this, the vizier got up and after riding to the khan, he approached Nur al-Din who, seeing him coming, rose to meet him. He greeted the vizier who, in turn, welcomed him, dismounted from his horse, and embraced him, making him sit beside him. ‘My son,’ he said, ‘where have you come from and what do you want?’ ‘Master,’ replied Nur al-Din, ‘I have come from Cairo. I was the son of a vizier there, but my father moved from this world to the mercy of Almighty God.’ He then told his story from beginning to end, adding: ‘I have made up my mind that I shall never return until I have passed through every city and every land.’ ‘My son,’ said the vizier when he heard this, ‘do not obey the promptings of pride or you will destroy yourself. The lands are desolate and I am afraid lest Time bring misfortunes on you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He then had Nur al-Din’s saddlebags placed on the mule and, taking the carpet and the prayer mat, he brought him to his house where he lodged him in elegant quarters and showed him honour, kindness and much affection. ‘My boy,’ he said to him, ‘I am an old man and I have no son, but God has provided me with a daughter who is your match in beauty and whose hand I have refused to many suitors. I have conceived love for you in my heart and so I ask whether you would be willing to take her to serve you, while you become her husband. If you accept, I shall bring you to the sultan of Basra and tell him that you are the son of my brother, and I shall get him to appoint you as his vizier in my place. I shall then stay at home, for I am an old man.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Nur al-Din heard what he had to say, he bowed his head and said: ‘To hear is to obey.’ The vizier was delighted and he told his servants to set out food and to decorate the main reception hall where the weddings of the emirs were held. He collected his friends and invited the great officials of state together with the merchants of Basra. When they came, he told them: ‘I had a brother, the vizier of Egypt. God provided him with two sons, while, as you know, He gave me a daughter. My brother had enjoined me to marry her to one of his sons. I agreed to this, and when the appropriate time for marriage came, he sent me one of his sons – this young man who is here with us. Now that he has arrived, I want to draw up the marriage contract between him and my daughter that the marriage may be consummated here, for he has a greater right to her hand than a stranger. After that, if he wants he can stay here, or if he prefers to leave, I shall send him and his wife off to his father.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone there approved of the plan and, looking at Nur al-Din, they admired what they saw. The vizier then brought in the qadis and the notaries, who drew up the contract. Incense was scattered, sugared drinks served and rosewater sprinkled, after which the guests left. The vizier then told his servants to take Nur al-Din to the baths. He gave him a special robe of his own and sent him towels, bowls and censers, together with everything else that he might need. When he left the baths wearing the robes, he was like the moon when it is full on the fourteenth night. He mounted his mule and rode on until he reached the vizier’s palace, where he dismounted. Entering the vizier’s presence, he kissed his hand and was welcomed…\n",

      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that after the sorceress had taken water from the pool and spoken some unintelligible words over it, the fish danced, lifted their heads and immediately rose up, as the magic spell was removed from the city. It became inhabited again, the merchants buying and selling and each man practising his craft, while the islands were restored to their former state. The sorceress went straight away to the tomb and said to the king: ‘Give me your noble hand, my darling, and get up.’ In a low voice, the king replied: ‘Come to me.’ When she did this he, with the drawn sword in his hand, struck her in the breast as she clung on to him, so that it emerged gleaming from her back. With another blow he cut her in two, and threw the two halves on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came out he found the young man whom she had enchanted standing waiting for him, congratulating him on his escape, kissing his hand and thanking him. The king asked him whether he would prefer to stay in his own city, or to go with him to his. ‘King of the age,’ said the young man, ‘do you know how long a journey it is to your city?’ ‘Two and a half days,’ replied the king. ‘If you have been sleeping,’ said the young man, ‘wake up. Between you and your city is a full year’s worth of hard travelling. You only got here in two and a half days because this place was under a spell. But I shall not part from you for the blink of an eye.’ The king was glad and said: ‘Praise be to God, Who has given you to me. You shall be my son, for all my life I have been granted no other.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They embraced with great joy and then walked to the palace. Here the young man told his courtiers to make ready for a journey and to collect supplies and whatever was needed. This took ten days, after which the young man and the king set off, the latter being in a fever of anxiety to get back his own city. They travelled with fifty mamluks and magnificent gifts, and their journey continued day and night for a whole year until, as God had decreed their safety, they eventually reached their goal. Word was sent to the vizier that the king had arrived safe and sound, and he, together with his soldiers, who had despaired of him, came to greet him, kissing the ground before him and congratulating him on his safe arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king then entered the city to take his seat on his throne, and the vizier, on presenting himself and hearing of all that had happened to the young man, added his own congratulations. Then, when things were settled, the king presented gifts to many people and he told the vizier to fetch the man who had brought him the fish and who had been responsible for saving the people of the enchanted city. A messenger was sent to him and when he was brought to the palace, the king presented him with robes of honour and asked him about his circumstances, and whether he had any children. The fisherman replied that he had two daughters and one son. The king sent for them and married one of the girls himself, giving the other to the young man. The fisherman’s son was made treasurer, while the vizier was invested and sent off as ruler of the capital of the Black Islands, the young man’s city. With him were sent the fifty mamluks who had come with the king, and he was given robes of honour to take to the emirs of the city. He kissed the king’s hands and started out immediately, while the king remained with the young man. The fisherman, meanwhile, had become the richest man of his age, while his daughters remained as wives of kings until they died.\n",

      "This, however, is not more remarkable than what happened to the porter. There was an unmarried porter who lived in the city of Baghdad. One day, while he was standing in the market, leaning on his basket, a woman came up to him wrapped in a silken Mosuli shawl with a floating ribbon and wearing embroidered shoes fringed with gold thread. When she raised her veil, beneath it could be seen dark eyes which, with their eyelashes and eyelids, shot soft glances, perfect in their quality. She turned to the porter and said in a sweet, clear voice: ‘Take your basket and follow me.’ Almost before he was sure of what she had said, he rushed to pick up the basket. ‘What a lucky day, a day of good fortune!’ he exclaimed, following her until she stopped by the door of a house. She knocked at it and a Christian came down to whom she gave a dinar, taking in exchange an olive-coloured jar of strained wine. She put this in the basket and said to the porter: ‘Pick this up and follow me.’ ‘By God,’ repeated the porter, ‘this is a blessed and a fortunate day!’ and he did what she told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then stopped at a fruiterer’s shop, where she bought Syrian apples, Uthmani quinces, Omani peaches, jasmine and water lilies from Syria, autumn cucumbers, lemons, sultani oranges, scented myrtle, privet flowers, camomile blossoms, red anemones, violets, pomegranate blooms and eglantine. All these she put into the porter’s basket, telling him to pick it up. This he did and he followed her until she stopped at the butcher’s, where she got the man to cut her ten ratls’ weight of meat. He did this, and after paying him, she wrapped the meat in banana leaves and put it in the basket, giving the porter his instructions. He picked up the basket and followed her to the grocer, from whom she bought pistachio kernels for making a dessert, Tihama raisins and shelled almonds. The porter was told to pick them up and to follow her. Next she stopped at the sweetmeat seller’s shop. This time she bought a bowl and filled it with all that he had – sugar cakes, doughnuts stuffed with musk, ‘soap’ cakes, lemon tarts, Maimuni tarts, ‘Zainab’s combs’, sugar fingers and ‘qadis’ snacks’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every type of pastry was piled on to a plate and put into the basket, at which the porter exclaimed: ‘If you had told me, I’d have brought a donkey with me to carry all this stuff.’ The girl smiled and gave him a cuff on the back of the neck. ‘Hurry up,’ she said. ‘Don’t talk so much and you will get your reward, if God Almighty wills it.’ Then she stopped at the perfume seller’s where she bought ten types of scented water – including rosewater, orange-flower water, waters scented with water lilies and with willow flowers – two sugar loaves, a bottle of musk-scented rosewater, a quantity of frankincense, aloes, ambergris, musk and Alexandrian candles. All of these she put in the basket, telling the porter to pick it up and follow her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He carried his basket and followed her to a handsome house, overlooking a spacious courtyard. It was a tall, pillared building, whose door had two ebony leaves, plated with red gold. The girl halted by the door, raised the veil from her face and knocked lightly, while the porter remained standing behind her, his thoughts occupied with her beauty. The door opened and, as its leaves parted, the porter looked at the person who had opened it. He saw a lady of medium height, with jutting breasts, beautiful, comely, resplendent, with a perfect and well-proportioned figure, a radiant brow, red cheeks and eyes rivalling those of a wild cow or a gazelle. Her eyebrows were like the crescent moon of the month of Sha‘ban; she had cheeks like red anemones, a mouth like the seal of Solomon, coral red lips, teeth like camomile blossoms or pearls on a string, and a gazelle-like neck. Her bosom was like an ornate fountain, with breasts like twin pomegranates; she had an elegant belly and a navel that could contain an ounce of unguent. She was as the poet described:\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the sun and the moon of the palaces,\n",
      "\n",
      "At the jewel in her nose and at her flowery splendour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your eye has not seen white on black\n",
      "\n",
      "United in beauty as in her face and in her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is rosy-cheeked; beauty proclaims her name,\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you are not fortunate enough to know of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She swayed and I laughed in wonder at her haunches,\n",
      "\n",
      "But her waist prompted my tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the porter stared at her, he lost his wits and the basket almost fell from his head. ‘Never in my life,’ he repeated, ‘have I known a more blessed day than this!’ The girl who had answered the door said to the other, who had brought the provisions: ‘Come in and take the basket from this poor porter.’ So the two girls went in, followed by the porter, and they went on until they reached a spacious, well-designed and beautiful courtyard, with additional carvings, vaulted chambers and alcoves, and furnished with sofas, wardrobes, cupboards and curtains. In the middle of it was a large pool filled with water on which floated a skiff, and at its upper end was a couch of juniper wood studded with gems over which was suspended a mosquito net of red satin, the buttons of whose fastenings were pearls as big as or bigger than hazelnuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "From within this emerged a resplendent girl of pleasing beauty, glorious as the moon, with the character of a philosopher. Her eyes were bewitching, with eyebrows like bent bows; her figure was slender and straight as the letter alif; her breath had the scent of ambergris; her lips were carnelian red, sweet as sugar; and her face would shame the light of the radiant sun. She was like one of the stars of heaven, a golden dome, an unveiled bride or a noble Bedouin lady, as described by the poet:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is as though she smiles to show stringed pearls,\n",
      "\n",
      "Hailstones or flowers of camomile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The locks of her hair hang black as night,\n",
      "\n",
      "While her beauty shames the light of dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This third girl rose from the couch and walked slowly to join her sisters in the centre of the hall. ‘Why are you standing here?’ she said. ‘Take the basket from the head of this poor porter.’ The provision buyer or housekeeper came first, followed by the doorkeeper, and the third girl helped them to lower the basket, after which they emptied out its contents and put everything in its place. Then they gave the porter two dinars and told him to be off. For his part, he looked at the lovely girls, the most beautiful he had ever seen, with their equally delightful natures. There were no men with them and, as he stared in astonishment at the wine, the fruits, the scented blossoms and all the rest, he was reluctant to leave. ‘Why don’t you go?’ asked the girl. ‘Do you think that we didn’t pay you enough?’ and with that, she turned to her sister and said: ‘Give him another dinar.’ ‘By God, lady,’ said the porter, ‘it was not that I thought that the payment was too little, for my fee would not come to two dirhams, but you have taken over my heart and soul. How is it that you are alone with no men here and no pleasant companion? You know that there must be four to share a proper feast and women cannot enjoy themselves except with men. As the poet says:\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you not see that four things join for entertainment –\n",
      "\n",
      "Harp, lute, zither and pipe,\n",
      "\n",
      "Matched by four scented flowers –\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose, myrtle, gillyflower, anemone.\n",
      "\n",
      "These only become pleasant with another four –\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine, gardens, a beloved and some gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three of you and so you need a fourth, who must be a man of intelligence, sensible, clever and one who can keep a secret.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The three girls were surprised by what the porter said, and they laughed at him and asked: ‘Who can produce us a man like that? We are girls and are afraid of entrusting our secrets to someone who would not keep them. We have read in an account what the poet Ibn al-Thumam once said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Guard your secret as you can, entrusting it to none,\n",
      "\n",
      "For if you do, you will have let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your own breast cannot contain your secret,\n",
      "\n",
      "How is it to be held by someone else?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Abu Nuwas has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever lets the people know his secret\n",
      "\n",
      "Deserves a brand imprinted on his forehead.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the porter heard what they said, he exclaimed: ‘By God, I am an intelligent and a trustworthy man; I have read books and studied histories; I make public what is good and conceal what is bad. As the poet says:\n",
      "\n",
      "Only the trustworthy can keep a secret,\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is with the good that secrets are concealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "With me they are kept locked inside a room\n",
      "\n",
      "Whose keys are lost and whose door has been sealed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girls heard this quotation, they said: ‘You know that we have spent a great deal of money on this place. Do you have anything with you which you can use to pay us back? We shall not let you sit with us as our companion and to look on our comely and beautiful faces until you pay down some money. Have you not heard what the author of the proverb said: “Love without cash is worthless”?’ The doorkeeper said: ‘My dear, if you have something, you are someone, but if you have nothing, then go without anything.’ At that point, however, the housekeeper said: ‘Sisters, let him be. For, by God, he has not failed us today, whereas someone else might not have put up with us, and whatever debt he may run up, I will settle for him.’ The porter was delighted and thanked her, kissing the ground, but the girl who had been on the couch said: ‘By God, we shall only let you sit with us on one condition, which is that you ask no questions about what does not concern you, and if you are inquisitive you will be beaten.’ ‘I agree, lady,’ said the porter. ‘I swear by my head and my eye, and here I am, a man with no tongue.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper then got up, tucked up her skirts, set out the wine bottles and strained the wine. She set green herbs beside the wine-jar and brought everything that might be needed. She then brought out the wine-jar and sat down with her two sisters, while the porter, sitting between the three of them, thought he must be dreaming. From the wine-jar that she had fetched she filled a cup, drank it, and followed it with a second and a third. Then she filled the cup and passed it to her sister and finally to the porter. She recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink with pleasure and the enjoyment of good health,\n",
      "\n",
      "For this wine is a cure for all disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The porter took the cup in his hand, bowed, thanked her and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine should be drunk beside a trusted friend,\n",
      "\n",
      "One of pure birth from the line of old heroes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For wine is like the wind, sweet if it passes scented flowers,\n",
      "\n",
      "But stinking if it blows over a corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "Take wine only from a fawn,\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtle in meaning when she speaks to you,\n",
      "\n",
      "Resembling the wine itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had recited these lines, he kissed the hand of each of the girls. Then he drank until he became tipsy, after which he swayed and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "The only blood we are allowed to drink\n",
      "\n",
      "Is blood that comes from grapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So pour this out for me, and may my life\n",
      "\n",
      "And all I have, both new and old,\n",
      "\n",
      "Serve to ransom your gazelle-like eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the housekeeper took the cup, filled it and gave it to the doorkeeper, who took it from him with thanks and drank it. She then filled it for the lady of the house, before pouring another cup and passing it to the porter, who kissed the ground in front of her, thanked her and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fetch wine, by God; bring me the brimming glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour it for me; this is the water of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went up to the mistress of the house and said: ‘Lady, I am your slave, your mamluk and your servant.’ He recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "By the door there stands a slave of yours,\n",
      "\n",
      "Acknowledging your kindly charity.\n",
      "\n",
      "May he come in, fair one, to see your loveliness?\n",
      "\n",
      "I swear by love itself I cannot leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied: ‘Enjoy yourself, drink with pleasure and the well-being that follows the path of health.’ He took the cup, kissed her hand and chanted:\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave her old wine, coloured like her cheeks,\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmixed and gleaming like a fiery brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "She kissed it and said, laughingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How can you pour us people’s cheeks?’\n",
      "\n",
      "I said: ‘Drink: this comes from my tears;\n",
      "\n",
      "Its redness is my blood;\n",
      "\n",
      "My breath has heated it within the glass.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied with the line:\n",
      "\n",
      "Companion, if you have wept blood for me,\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour it obediently for me to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She then took the cup, drank it and sat down with her sister. They continued to drink, with the porter seated between them, and as they drank, they danced, laughed and sang, reciting poems and lyrics. The porter began to play with them, kissing, biting, rubbing, feeling, touching and taking liberties. One of them would give him morsels to eat, another would cuff him and slap him, and the third would bring him scented flowers. With them he was enjoying the pleasantest of times, as though he was seated among the houris of Paradise.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went on in this way until the wine had taken its effect on their heads and their brains. When it had got the upper hand of them, the doorkeeper stood up, stripped off her clothes until she was naked, and letting down her hair as a veil, she jumped into the pool. She sported in the water, ducking her head and then spitting out the water, after which she took some in her mouth and spat it over the porter. She washed her limbs and between her thighs, after which she came out from the water and threw herself down on his lap. ‘My master, my darling, what is the name of this?’ she said, pointing to her vagina. ‘Your womb,’ he replied. ‘Oh!’ she said. ‘Have you no shame?’ and she seized him by the neck and started to cuff him. ‘Your vagina,’ he said, and she cuffed him again on the back of his neck, saying: ‘Oh! Oh! How disgusting! Aren’t you ashamed?’ ‘Your vulva,’ he replied. ‘Do you feel no shame for your honour?’ and she struck him a blow with her hand. ‘Your hornet,’ he said, at which the lady of the house pounced on him and beat him, saying: ‘Don’t speak like that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "With every new name that he produced, the girls beat him more and more, until the back of his neck had almost dissolved under their slaps. They were laughing among themselves, until he asked: ‘What do you call it, then?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ replied the doorkeeper. ‘Thank God, I am safe now,’ said the porter. ‘Good for you, mint of the dykes.’ Then the wine was passed round again, and the housekeeper got up, took off her clothes and threw herself on to the porter’s lap. ‘What is this called, light of my eyes?’ she asked, pointing at her private parts. ‘Your vagina,’ he said. ‘Oh, how dirty of you!’ she exclaimed, and she struck him a blow that resounded around the hall, adding: ‘Oh! Oh! Have you no shame?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he said, but blows and slaps still rained on the back of his neck. He tried another four names, but the girls kept on saying: ‘No, no!’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he repeated, and they laughed so much that they fell over backwards. Then they fell to beating his neck, saying: ‘No, that’s not its name.’ He said: ‘O my sisters, what is it called?’ ‘Husked sesame,’ they said. Then the housekeeper put her clothes back on and they sat, drinking together, with the porter groaning at the pain in his neck and shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the wine had been passed round again, the lady of the house, the most beautiful of the three, stood up and stripped off her clothes. The porter grasped the back of his neck with his hand and massaged it, saying: ‘My neck and my shoulders are common property.’ When the girl was naked, she jumped into the pool, dived under water, played around and washed herself. To the porter in her nakedness she looked like a sliver of the moon, with a face like the full moon when it rises or the dawn when it breaks. He looked at her figure, her breasts and her heavy buttocks as they swayed, while she was naked as her Lord had created her. ‘Oh! Oh!’ he said, and he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I compare your figure to a sappy branch,\n",
      "\n",
      "I load my heart with wrongs and with injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Branches are most beautiful when concealed with leaves,\n",
      "\n",
      "While you are loveliest when we meet you naked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing these lines, the girl came out of the pool and sat on the porter’s lap. She pointed at her vulva and said: ‘Little master, what is the name of this?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he replied, and when she exclaimed in disgust, he tried ‘the husked sesame’. ‘Bah!’ she said. ‘Your womb,’ he suggested. ‘Oh! Oh! Aren’t you ashamed?’ and she slapped the back of his neck. Whatever name he produced, she slapped him, saying: ‘No, no,’ until he asked: ‘Sisters, what is it called?’ ‘The khan of Abu Mansur,’ they replied. ‘Praise God that I have reached safety at last,’ he said. ‘Ho for the khan of Abu Mansur!’ The girl got up and put on her clothes and they all went back to what they had been doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a time the wine circulated among them and the porter then got up, undressed and went into the pool. The girls looked at him swimming in the water and washing under his beard and beneath his armpits, as they had done. Then he came out and threw himself into the lap of the lady of the house, with his arms in the lap of the doorkeeper and his feet and legs in the lap of the girl who had bought the provisions. Then he pointed to his penis and said: ‘Ladies, what is the name of this?’ They all laughed at this until they fell over backwards. ‘Your zubb,’ one of them suggested. ‘No,’ he said, and he bit each of them. ‘Your air,’ they said, but he repeated ‘No’, and embraced each of them.\n",

      "order! He deserves gifts and favours and I shall always treat him as\n",
      "\n",
      "a friend and companion.’ The king passed a happy night, gladdened\n",
      "\n",
      "by the soundness of his body and his freedom from disease. The next\n",

      "day, he went out and sat on his throne, while his state o\u0000cials stood\n",

      "\n",
      "envious that he was in love with envy. When this man saw that the\n",
      "\n",
      "king had taken Duban as an intimate and had rewarded him with\n",
      "\n",
      "favours, he was jealous and planned to do him an injury. For, as the\n",

      "This vizier came up to King Yunan, kissed the ground before him\n",

      "from you, I would show myself to be a bastard, but if you tell me to\n",

      "give it to you, I shall do so.’ Yunan was disturbed by this and said:\n",

      "‘What is this advice of yours?’ The vizier replied: ‘Great king, it was\n",

      "not look at the consequences of their actions. I have observed that\n",

      "who he was talking about. ‘If you are asleep, wake up,’ the vizier\n",
      "\n",
      "told him, and went on: ‘I am talking about the sage Duban.’ ‘Damn\n",

      "monthly income of a thousand dinars, while even if I divided my\n",

      "that has made you say this, reminding me of the story of King\n",

      "\n",
      "You must know that there was a Persian king with a passion for\n",

      "reared a falcon which was his constant companion by night and by\n",

      "day, and which would spend the night perched on his wrist. He\n",
      "\n",
      "would take it hunting with him and he had a golden bowl made for\n",
      "\n",
      "it which he hung round its neck and from which it could drink. One\n",
      "\n",
      "day the chief falconer came to where he was sitting and told him\n",
      "\n",
      "that it was time to go out hunting. The king gave the orders and\n",

      "went o\u0000 with the falcon on his wrist until he and his party reached\n",
      "\n",
      "a wadi, where they spread out their hunting cordon. Trapped in this\n",
      "\n",
      "was a gazelle and the king threatened that anyone who allowed it to\n",
      "\n",
      "leap over his head would be put to death. When the cordon was\n",
      "\n",
      "narrowed, the gazelle came to where the king was posted, supported\n",
      "\n",
      "itself on its hindlegs and placed its forelegs on its chest as though it\n",
      "\n",
      "was kissing the ground before him. He bent his head towards it and\n",
      "\n",
      "it then jumped over him, making for the open country. He noticed\n",
      "\n",
      "that his men were looking at him and winking at each other and\n",
      "\n",
      "when he asked his vizier what this meant, the man explained: ‘They\n",

      "over his head, he would be killed.’\n",

      "The king then swore that he would hunt it down and he rode o\u0000\n",

      "in pursuit, following the gazelle until he came to a mountain. There\n",
      "\n",
      "it was about to pass through a cleft when the king loosed his falcon\n",
      "\n",
      "at it and the bird clawed at its eyes, blinding and dazing it, so that\n",
      "\n",
      "the king could draw his mace and knock it over with a single blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then dismounted and cut its throat, after which he skinned it and\n",
      "\n",
      "tied it to his saddlebow. As this was in the noonday heat and the\n",
      "\n",
      "region was desolate and waterless, both the king and his horse were\n",
      "\n",
      "thirsty by now. The king scouted round and discovered a tree from\n",
      "\n",
      "which what looked like liquid butter was dripping. Wearing a pair\n",
      "\n",
      "of kid gloves, he took the bowl from the falcon’s neck, \u0000lled it with\n",
      "\n",
      "this liquid and set it in front of the bird, but it knocked the bowl\n",
      "\n",
      "and overturned it. The king took it and \u0000lled it again, thinking that\n",
      "\n",
      "the falcon must be thirsty, but the same thing happened when he\n",
      "\n",
      "put it down a second time. This annoyed him and he went a third\n",
      "\n",
      "time to \u0000ll the bowl and take it to his horse, but this time the falcon\n",
      "\n",
      "upset it with its wing. The king cursed it, exclaiming: ‘You\n",
      "\n",
      "unluckiest of birds, you have stopped me drinking, and have\n",
      "\n",
      "stopped yourself and the horse.’ He then struck o\u0000 its wing with a\n",
      "\n",
      "blow from his sword, but the bird raised its head as though to say\n",
      "\n",
      "by its gesture: ‘Look at the top of the tree.’ The king raised his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "and what he saw there was a brood of vipers whose poison was\n",
      "\n",
      "dripping down. Immediately regretting what he had done, he\n",
      "\n",
      "mounted his horse and rode back to his pavilion, bringing with him\n",
      "\n",
      "the gazelle, which he handed to the cook, telling him to take it and\n",
      "\n",
      "roast it. As he sat on his chair with the falcon on his wrist, it drew\n",
      "\n",
      "its last breath and died, leaving its master to exclaim with sorrow\n",

      "help you. I have been in the sea for eighteen hundred years and this\n",

      "wriggled about in the water, he placed the bowl on his head and\n",
      "\n",
      "went to the palace as the ‘ifrit had told him. When he came to the\n",
      "\n",
      "king and presented him with the \u0000sh, the king was astonished, for\n",
      "\n",
      "never in his life had he seen anything like them. He gave orders that\n",
      "\n",
      "they were to be handed over to a slave girl who was acting as cook\n",
      "\n",
      "but whose skill had not yet been tested, as she had been given him\n",
      "\n",
      "three days earlier by the king of Rum. The vizier told her to fry the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000sh, adding that the king had said that he was testing her only in\n",
      "\n",
      "the hour of need, and that he was putting his hopes in her artistry\n",
      "\n",
      "and cooking skills, for the \u0000sh had been given him as a present.\n",
      "\n",
      "After issuing these instructions, the vizier went back to the king,\n",
      "\n",
      "who told him to hand the \u0000sherman four hundred dinars. After he\n",
      "\n",
      "had passed over the money, the man stowed it inside his clothes and\n",

      "set o\u0000 back home at a run, falling, getting up and then stumbling\n",

      "needed for his family and then returned to his wife in joy and\n",
      "\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much for him, but as for the slave girl, she took the \u0000sh and\n",
      "\n",
      "cleaned them. Then, after setting the frying pan on the \u0000re, she put\n",
      "\n",
      "the \u0000sh in it and when one side was properly cooked, she turned\n",
      "\n",
      "them on to the other. All of a sudden, the kitchen wall split open\n",
      "\n",
      "and out came a girl, with a beautiful \u0000gure and smooth cheeks,\n",
      "\n",
      "perfect in all her attributes. Her eyes were darkened with kohl and\n",
      "\n",
      "she had on a silken ka\u0000yeh with a blue fringe. She was wearing\n",
      "\n",
      "earrings; on her wrists were a pair of bracelets, while her \u0000ngers\n",
      "\n",
      "were adorned with rings set with precious gems, and in her hand\n",
      "\n",
      "she held a bamboo sta\u0000. Thrusting this into the pan, she asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fish, are you still faithful to your covenant?’ at which the cook\n",
      "\n",
      "fainted. The girl repeated her question a second and a third time\n",
      "\n",
      "and the \u0000sh raised their heads from the pan and said: ‘Yes, yes,’ in\n",
      "\n",
      "clear voices, and then they recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you return, we return;\n",

      "\n",
      "But if you go o\u0000, we are quits.\n",

      "\n",
      "through the hole from which she had come, after which the wall\n",
      "\n",
      "closed up behind her. The cook recovered from her faint and saw\n",
      "\n",
      "the four \u0000sh burned like black charcoal. She exclaimed: ‘His spear\n",
      "\n",
      "was broken on his very \u0000rst raid!’ and fell unconscious again on the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000oor. While she was in this confused state, the vizier came and saw\n",
      "\n",
      "that something had gone badly wrong with her, so much so that she\n",
      "\n",
      "could not even tell what day of the week it was. He nudged her with\n",
      "\n",
      "his foot, and when she had recovered her senses, she explained to\n",
      "\n",
      "him, in tears, what had happened. He was astonished, and\n",
      "\n",
      "exclaimed: ‘This is something wonderful!’ He then sent for the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000sherman and, when he was brought in, the vizier told him to fetch\n",
      "\n",
      "another four \u0000sh like the \u0000rst ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \u0000sherman went to the pool, cast his net and when he drew it\n",
      "\n",
      "in, there were four \u0000sh like the \u0000rst. He took them to the vizier,\n",
      "\n",
      "who brought them to the cook and said: ‘Fry these in front of me so\n",
      "\n",
      "that I can see what happens.’ The cook got up, prepared the \u0000sh, put\n",
      "\n",
      "the pan over the \u0000re and threw them into it. As soon as she did, the\n",
      "\n",
      "wall split open and out came the girl, looking as she had done\n",
      "\n",
      "before, with a sta\u0000 in her hand. She prodded the pan and asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fish, \u0000sh, are you true to your old covenant?’ At this, all the \u0000sh\n",
      "\n",
      "raised their heads and repeated the lines:\n",

      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",

      "been allowed to say. Then, when it was the seventh night, she\n",
      "\n",
      "continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that, when the \u0000sh spoke, the\n",
      "\n",
      "girl overturned the pan with her sta\u0000 and then left by the way she\n",
      "\n",
      "had come, with the wall closing behind her. At that, the vizier got\n",
      "\n",
      "up and said: ‘This is something which must not be kept from the\n",
      "\n",
      "king.’ So he went to the king and told him the story, explaining\n",
      "\n",
      "what he had seen for himself. ‘I must see this with my own eyes,’\n",
      "\n",
      "said the king, and at that the \u0000sherman was sent for and told to\n",
      "\n",
      "bring another four \u0000sh like the others. He went down to the pool\n",
      "\n",
      "with three guards as an escort and brought the \u0000sh immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king ordered him to be given four hundred dinars, after which\n",
      "\n",
      "he turned to the vizier and told him: ‘Come and cook these \u0000sh in\n",
      "\n",
      "my presence.’ The vizier did as he was told, brought the pan and,\n",
      "\n",
      "after preparing the \u0000sh, he put the pan over the \u0000re and threw them\n",
      "\n",
      "into it. As soon as he did so, the wall split open and out came a\n",
      "\n",
      "black slave, tall as a mountain or like a survivor of the race of ‘Ad.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his hand was a green bough and he asked in a hectoring voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fish, \u0000sh, are you true to your old covenant?’ The \u0000sh raised their\n",
      "\n",
      "heads from the pan and replied: ‘Yes, yes, we keep to our covenant.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you return, we return;\n",
      "\n",
      "If you keep faith, then so do we,\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you go o\u0000, we are quits.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The slave came up to the pan, overturned it with the branch that\n",
      "\n",
      "he was holding, and left by the way that he had come. The vizier\n",
      "\n",
      "and the king looked at the \u0000sh and saw that they were now like\n",
      "\n",
      "charcoal. The king was amazed and said: ‘This is something that\n",
      "\n",
      "cannot be kept quiet and there must be some secret attached to\n",
      "\n",
      "them.’ So he gave orders for the \u0000sherman to be summoned and\n",
      "\n",
      "when the man came, the king asked him where the \u0000sh came from.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘From a pool surrounded by four mountains,’ replied the \u0000sherman,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘and it is under the mountain outside the city.’ The king turned and\n",
      "\n",
      "asked: ‘How many days’ journey is it?’ and the \u0000sherman told him\n",
      "\n",
      "that it was half an hour away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This astonished the king and he ordered his troops to mount and\n",
      "\n",
      "ride immediately, with the \u0000sherman at their head, while the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000sherman, in his turn, as he accompanied the king, spent his time\n",
      "\n",
      "cursing the ‘ifrit. The riders climbed up the mountain and then went\n",
      "\n",
      "down into a broad plain that they had never seen before in their\n",
      "\n",
      "lives. Everyone, including the king, was \u0000lled with wonder when\n",
      "\n",
      "they looked at it and at the pool in its centre, set as it was between\n",
      "\n",
      "four mountains, with its \u0000sh of four colours – red, white, yellow and\n",
      "\n",
      "blue. The king halted in astonishment and asked his soldiers and the\n",
      "\n",
      "others there whether they had ever seen the pool before. ‘King of\n",
      "\n",
      "the age,’ they replied, ‘never in all our lives have we set eyes on it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The elderly were asked about it, but they too said that they had\n",
      "\n",
      "never before seen the pool there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king then swore by God: ‘I shall not enter my city or sit on\n",
      "\n",
      "my throne again until I \u0000nd out the secret of this pool and of these\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000sh.’ He gave orders for his men to camp around the mountains, and\n",
      "\n",
      "then summoned his vizier, a learned, wise and sensible man, with a\n",
      "\n",
      "knowledge of a\u0000airs. When he came into the king’s presence, the\n",
      "\n",
      "king said to him: ‘I am going to tell you what I want to do. It has\n",
      "\n",
      "struck me that I should go out alone tonight and investigate the\n",
      "\n",
      "secret of this pool and of these \u0000sh. I want you to sit at the entrance\n",
      "\n",
      "of my tent and to tell the emirs, viziers, chamberlains and deputies,\n",
      "\n",
      "as well as everyone who asks about me, that I am unwell and that\n",
      "\n",
      "you have my instructions not to allow anyone to come in to see me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t tell anyone what I am planning to do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The vizier was in no position to disobey and so the king changed\n",
      "\n",
      "his clothes and strapped on his sword. He climbed down from one of\n",
      "\n",
      "the mountains and walked on for the rest of the night until morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent all the next day walking in the intense heat, and carried on\n",
      "\n",
      "for a second night until morning. At that point, he was pleased to\n",
      "\n",
      "see something black in the distance, and he said to himself: ‘Perhaps\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall \u0000nd someone to tell me about the pool and the \u0000sh.’ When he\n",
      "\n",
      "went nearer he found a palace made of black stones plated with\n",
      "\n",
      "iron, one leaf of whose gate was open and the other shut. Joyfully\n",
      "\n",
      "he stood by the door and knocked lightly; on hearing no reply, he\n",
      "\n",
      "knocked a second and a third time, and when there was still no\n",
      "\n",
      "answer, he knocked more loudly. When no one answered, he was\n",
      "\n",
      "sure that the palace must be empty and so, plucking up his courage,\n",
      "\n",
      "he went through the gate to the passage that led from it, and called\n",
      "\n",
      "out: ‘People of the palace, here is a passing stranger. Have you any\n",
      "\n",
      "food?’\n",
      "\n",
      "He repeated this a second and a third time, and when there was\n",
      "\n",
      "still no reply, emboldened and heartened, he went through the\n",
      "\n",
      "passage to the centre of the palace. This was furnished with silks,\n",
      "\n",
      "starry tapestries and other hangings, but there was no one there. In\n",
      "\n",
      "the centre was an open space, leading to four halls. There was a\n",
      "\n",
      "stone bench, and one hall next to another, then an ornate fountain\n",
      "\n",
      "and four lions of red gold, from whose mouths water poured,\n",
      "\n",
      "glittering like pearls or gems. Round and about were birds and over\n",
      "\n",
      "the top of the palace there was a net of gold that kept them from\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000ying away, but the king was astonished and saddened that he had\n",
      "\n",
      "not seen anyone whom he could ask about the plain, the pool, the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000sh, the mountains and the palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was sitting between the doors, sunk in thought, when\n",
      "\n",
      "suddenly he heard a plaintive sound coming from a sorrowful heart,\n",
      "\n",
      "with a voice chanting these verses:\n",
      "\n",
      "I try to hide what I su\u0000er at your hands, but this is clear,\n",
      "\n",
      "With my eyes exchanging sleep for sleeplessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time, you neither spare me nor cease your work,\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is between hardship and danger that my heart lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you no mercy on one whom love’s law has abased,\n",
      "\n",
      "Or on the wealthy who is now made poor?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was jealous of the breeze as it blows over you,\n",
      "\n",
      "But when fate pounces, then men’s eyes are blind.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can the archer do if, as he meets the foe,\n",
      "\n",
      "His bow-string snaps just when he wants to shoot?\n",
      "\n",
      "When cares mass to assault a man,\n",
      "\n",
      "Where can he \u0000ee from destiny and fate?\n",
      "\n",
      "When the king heard this lament, he got up and, following the\n",
      "\n",
      "sound, he found a curtain lowered over the door of a room. He lifted\n",
      "\n",
      "it and behind it he found a handsome young man, well made,\n",
      "\n",
      "eloquent, with a bright face, ruddy cheeks and a mole on his cheek\n",
      "\n",
      "like a disc of amber. He was seated on a couch raised one cubit from\n",
      "\n",
      "the ground and he \u0000tted the poet’s description:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is many a slender one whose dark hair and bright\n",
      "\n",
      "forehead\n",
      "\n",
      "Have made mankind to walk in dark and light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not \u0000nd fault with the mole upon his cheek:\n",
      "\n",
      "I would sell my brother in exchange for such a speck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king was glad to see him and greeted him. He, for his part,\n",
      "\n",
      "was sitting there wearing a silk gown embroidered with Egyptian\n",
      "\n",
      "gold, and on his head was a crown studded with gems. He was\n",
      "\n",
      "showing signs of grief, but when the king greeted him, he replied\n",
      "\n",
      "with the utmost courtesy: ‘Your dignity deserves that I should rise\n",
      "\n",
      "for you, but I have an excuse for not doing so.’ ‘I excuse you, young\n",
      "\n",
      "man,’ said the king. ‘I am your guest and I am also here on an\n",
      "\n",
      "important errand. I want you to tell me about the pool, the \u0000sh, this\n",
      "\n",
      "palace, the reason why you are here alone and why you are\n",
      "\n",
      "weeping.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When the young man heard this, tears coursed down his cheeks\n",
      "\n",
      "and he wept bitterly until his breast was drenched. He then recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Say to the one to whom Time grants sleep,\n",
      "\n",
      "How often misfortunes subside only to rise up!\n",
      "\n",
      "While you may sleep, God’s eye remains sleepless.\n",
      "\n",
      "For whom is Time unclouded and for whom do worldly things\n",
      "\n",
      "endure?\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed deeply and continued to recite:\n",
      "\n",
      "Entrust your a\u0000air to the Lord of all mankind;\n",
      "\n",
      "Abandon care and leave aside anxious thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not ask how what happened has occurred,\n",
      "\n",
      "For all things come about through the decree of fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king, \u0000lled with wonder, asked the youth why he was\n",
      "\n",
      "weeping. ‘How can I not shed tears,’ he replied, ‘when I am in this\n",
      "\n",
      "state?’ and he reached down to the skirts of his robe and raised it. It\n",
      "\n",
      "could then be seen that the lower half of his body, down to his feet,\n",
      "\n",
      "was of stone, while from his navel to the hair of his head he was\n",
      "\n",
      "human. When he saw this condition of his, the king was \u0000lled with\n",
      "\n",
      "grief and regret. He exclaimed in sorrow: ‘Young man, you have\n",
      "\n",
      "added another care to my cares! I was looking for information about\n",
      "\n",
      "the \u0000sh, but now I see I must ask both about them and about you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on to recite the formula: ‘There is no power and no\n",
      "\n",
      "strength except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent,’ and added:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tell me at once what your story is.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Listen and look,’ said the young man. ‘My ears and eyes are\n",

      "marvellous tale attached to the \u0000sh and to me, which, were it\n",
      "\n",
      "written with needles on the corners of the eyes, would be a lesson\n",
      "\n",
      "for all who can learn.’ ‘How is that?’ asked the king, AND THE YOUNG\n",

      "could no longer speak, and he was alive only because his allotted\n",

      "my wife would go to the tomb weeping and lamenting for him, and\n",
      "\n",
      "she would give him wine and broth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things went on like this until it came to the second year. I had\n",

      "been long-su\u0000ering and had paid no attention to her, until one day,\n",

      "Talk to me, O my soul; speak to me, my darling.’ She recited:\n",

      "\n",

      "If every blessing and all this world were mine,\n",
      "\n",
      "Together with the empire of the Persian kings,\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "If my eyes could not look on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had \u0000nished speaking and weeping, I said to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Cousin, that is enough of sorrow, and more weeping will do you no\n",
      "\n",
      "good.’ ‘Do not try to stop me doing what I must do,’ she said, ‘for in\n",
      "\n",
      "that case, I shall kill myself.’ I said no more and left her to do what\n",
      "\n",
      "she wanted, and she went on grieving, weeping and mourning for a\n",
      "\n",
      "second year and then a third. One day, I went to her when\n",
      "\n",
      "something had put me out of temper and I was tired of the violence\n",
      "\n",
      "of her distress. I found her going towards the tomb beneath the\n",
      "\n",
      "dome, saying: ‘Master, I hear no word from you. Master, why don’t\n",
      "\n",
      "you answer me?’ Then she recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Grave, grave, have the beloved’s beauties faded?\n",
      "\n",
      "And has the brightness and the radiance gone?\n",
      "\n",
      "Grave, you are neither earth nor heaven for me,\n",
      "\n",
      "So how is it you hold both sun and moon?\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard what she said and the lines she recited, I became\n",
      "\n",
      "even angrier than before and I exclaimed: ‘How long will this\n",
      "\n",
      "sorrow last?’ Then I recited myself:\n",
      "\n",
      "Grave, grave, has his blackness faded?\n",
      "\n",
      "And has the brightness and the foulness failed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Grave, you are neither basin nor a pot,\n",
      "\n",
      "So how is it you hold charcoal and slime?\n",
      "\n",
      "When she heard this, she jumped up and said: ‘Damn you, you\n",
      "\n",
      "dog. It was you who did this to me and wounded my heart’s darling.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have caused me pain and robbed him of his youth, so that for\n",
      "\n",
      "three years he has been neither dead nor alive.’ To which I replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dirty whore, \u0000lthiest of the fornicators and the prostitutes of black\n",
      "\n",
      "slaves, yes, it was I who did that.’ Then I drew my sword and aimed\n",
      "\n",
      "a deadly blow at her, but when she heard what I said and saw that I\n",
      "\n",
      "was intending to kill her, she burst out laughing and said: ‘O\u0000, you\n",
      "\n",
      "dog! What is past cannot return and the dead cannot rise again, but\n",
      "\n",
      "God has given the man who did this to me into my power. Because\n",
      "\n",
      "of him there has been an unquenchable \u0000re in my heart and a \u0000ame\n",
      "\n",
      "that cannot be hidden.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as she stood there, she spoke some unintelligible words\n",
      "\n",
      "and added: ‘Through my magic become half stone and half man.’ It\n",
      "\n",
      "was then that I became as you see me now, unable to stand or to sit,\n",
      "\n",
      "neither dead nor alive. After this, she cast a spell over the whole\n",
      "\n",
      "city, together with its markets and its gardens. It had contained four\n",
      "\n",
      "di\u0000erent groups, Muslims, Christians, Jews and Magians, and these\n",
      "\n",
      "she transformed into \u0000sh – the white \u0000sh being the Muslims, the red\n",
      "\n",
      "the Magians, the blue the Christians and the yellow the Jews – and\n",
      "\n",
      "she transformed the four islands into four mountains that surround\n",
      "\n",
      "the pool. Every day she tortures me by giving me a hundred lashes\n",
      "\n",
      "with her whip until the blood \u0000ows down over my shoulders. Then\n",
      "\n",
      "she dresses me in a hair shirt of the kind that I am wearing on my\n",
      "\n",
      "upper half, over which she places this splendid gown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man then wept and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "O my God, I must endure Your judgement and decree,\n",
      "\n",
      "And if that pleases You, I shall do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tyrants have wronged me and oppressed me here,\n",
      "\n",
      "But Paradise may be my recompense.\n",
      "\n",
      "My su\u0000erings have left me in sad straits,\n",
      "\n",
      "But God’s choice as His favoured Prophet intercedes for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king then turned to the youth and said: ‘Although you have\n",
      "\n",
      "freed me from one worry, you have added another to my cares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where is the woman and where is the tomb with the wounded\n",
      "\n",
      "slave?’ ‘He is lying in his tomb beneath the dome,’ said the young\n",
      "\n",
      "man, ‘and she is in that chamber opposite the door. She comes out\n",
      "\n",
      "once each day at sunrise, and the \u0000rst thing she does is to strip me\n",
      "\n",
      "and give me a hundred lashes. I weep and call out but I cannot\n",
      "\n",
      "move to defend myself, and after she has tortured me, she takes\n",
      "\n",
      "wine and broth to the slave. She will come early tomorrow.’ ‘By\n",
      "\n",
      "God, young man,’ said the king, ‘I shall do you a service for which I\n",
      "\n",
      "shall be remembered and which will be recorded until the end of\n",
      "\n",
      "time.’ He then sat talking to him until nightfall, when they both\n",
      "\n",
      "slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Close to dawn the king rose, stripped o\u0000 his clothes, drew his\n",
      "\n",
      "sword and went to where the slave lay, surrounded by candles,\n",
      "\n",
      "lamps, perfumes and unguents. He came up to the slave and killed\n",
      "\n",
      "him with one blow, before lifting him on to his back and throwing\n",
      "\n",
      "him down a well in the palace. After that, he wrapped himself in the\n",
      "\n",
      "slave’s clothes and lay down in the tomb with the naked sword by\n",
      "\n",
      "his side. After an hour, the damned sorceress arrived, but before she\n",
      "\n",
      "entered the tomb, she \u0000rst stripped her cousin of his clothes, took a\n",
      "\n",
      "whip and beat him. He cried out in pain: ‘The state that I am in is\n",
      "\n",
      "punishment enough for me, cousin; have pity on me.’ ‘Did you have\n",
      "\n",
      "pity on me,’ she asked, ‘and did you leave me, my beloved?’ She\n",
      "\n",
      "beat him until she was tired and the blood \u0000owed down his sides;\n",

      "\n",
      "At the tomb she wept and wailed, saying: ‘Master, speak to me;\n",

      "blacks, he said: ‘Oh, oh, there is no might and no power except with\n",
      "\n",
      "God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent!’ When she heard this, she cried\n",

      "‘Master, is this true?’ The king, in a weak voice, said: ‘You damned\n",

      "Baghdad. One day, while he was standing in the market, leaning on\n",

      "his basket, a woman came up to him wrapped in a silken Mosuli\n",
      "\n",
      "shawl with a \u0000oating ribbon and wearing embroidered shoes fringed\n",
      "\n",
      "with gold thread. When she raised her veil, beneath it could be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "dark eyes which, with their eyelashes and eyelids, shot soft glances,\n",
      "\n",
      "perfect in their quality. She turned to the porter and said in a sweet,\n",

      "clear voice: ‘Take your basket and follow me.’ Almost before he was\n",
      "\n",
      "sure of what she had said, he rushed to pick up the basket. ‘What a\n",

      "she stopped by the door of a house. She knocked at it and a\n",
      "\n",
      "Christian came down to whom she gave a dinar, taking in exchange\n",
      "\n",
      "an olive-coloured jar of strained wine. She put this in the basket and\n",

      "said to the porter: ‘Pick this up and follow me.’ ‘By God,’ repeated\n",

      "\n",
      "from Syria, autumn cucumbers, lemons, sultani oranges, scented\n",

      "followed her until she stopped at the butcher’s, where she got the\n",

      "man to cut her ten ratls’ weight of meat. He did this, and after\n",
      "\n",
      "paying him, she wrapped the meat in banana leaves and put it in\n",
      "\n",
      "the basket, giving the porter his instructions. He picked up the\n",
      "\n",
      "basket and followed her to the grocer, from whom she bought\n",
      "\n",
      "pistachio kernels for making a dessert, Tihama raisins and shelled\n",
      "\n",
      "almonds. The porter was told to pick them up and to follow her.\n",

      "Next she stopped at the sweetmeat seller’s shop. This time she\n",

      "talk so much and you will get your reward, if God Almighty wills it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she stopped at the perfume seller’s where she bought ten types\n",

      "of scented water – including rosewater, orange-\u0000ower water, waters\n",
      "\n",
      "scented with water lilies and with willow \u0000owers – two sugar\n",

      "\n",
      "He carried his basket and followed her to a handsome house,\n",
      "\n",
      "overlooking a spacious courtyard. It was a tall, pillared building,\n",
      "\n",
      "whose door had two ebony leaves, plated with red gold. The girl\n",
      "\n",
      "halted by the door, raised the veil from her face and knocked\n",
      "\n",
      "lightly, while the porter remained standing behind her, his thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "occupied with her beauty. The door opened and, as its leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "parted, the porter looked at the person who had opened it. He saw a\n",
      "\n",
      "lady of medium height, with jutting breasts, beautiful, comely,\n",
      "\n",
      "resplendent, with a perfect and well-proportioned \u0000gure, a radiant\n",
      "\n",
      "brow, red cheeks and eyes rivalling those of a wild cow or a gazelle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her eyebrows were like the crescent moon of the month of Sha‘ban;\n",
      "\n",
      "she had cheeks like red anemones, a mouth like the seal of Solomon,\n",
      "\n",
      "coral red lips, teeth like camomile blossoms or pearls on a string,\n",
      "\n",
      "and a gazelle-like neck. Her bosom was like an ornate fountain, with\n",
      "\n",
      "breasts like twin pomegranates; she had an elegant belly and a navel\n",
      "\n",
      "that could contain an ounce of unguent. She was as the poet\n",
      "\n",
      "described:\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the sun and the moon of the palaces,\n",
      "\n",
      "At the jewel in her nose and at her \u0000owery splendour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your eye has not seen white on black\n",
      "\n",
      "United in beauty as in her face and in her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is rosy-cheeked; beauty proclaims her name,\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you are not fortunate enough to know of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She swayed and I laughed in wonder at her haunches,\n",
      "\n",
      "But her waist prompted my tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the porter stared at her, he lost his wits and the basket almost\n",
      "\n",
      "fell from his head. ‘Never in my life,’ he repeated, ‘have I known a\n",
      "\n",
      "more blessed day than this!’ The girl who had answered the door\n",
      "\n",
      "said to the other, who had brought the provisions: ‘Come in and\n",

      "take the basket from this poor porter.’ So the two girls went in,\n",
      "\n",
      "followed by the porter, and they went on until they reached a\n",

      "spacious, well-designed and beautiful courtyard, with additional\n",
      "\n",
      "carvings, vaulted chambers and alcoves, and furnished with sofas,\n",
      "\n",
      "wardrobes, cupboards and curtains. In the middle of it was a large\n",
      "\n",
      "pool \u0000lled with water on which \u0000oated a ski\u0000, and at its upper end\n",
      "\n",
      "was a couch of juniper wood studded with gems over which was\n",
      "\n",
      "suspended a mosquito net of red satin, the buttons of whose\n",
      "\n",
      "fastenings were pearls as big as or bigger than hazelnuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "From within this emerged a resplendent girl of pleasing beauty,\n",
      "\n",
      "glorious as the moon, with the character of a philosopher. Her eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "were bewitching, with eyebrows like bent bows; her \u0000gure was\n",
      "\n",
      "slender and straight as the letter alif; her breath had the scent of\n",
      "\n",
      "ambergris; her lips were carnelian red, sweet as sugar; and her face\n",
      "\n",
      "would shame the light of the radiant sun. She was like one of the\n",
      "\n",
      "stars of heaven, a golden dome, an unveiled bride or a noble\n",
      "\n",
      "Bedouin lady, as described by the poet:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is as though she smiles to show stringed pearls,\n",
      "\n",
      "Hailstones or \u0000owers of camomile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The locks of her hair hang black as night,\n",
      "\n",
      "While her beauty shames the light of dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "This third girl rose from the couch and walked slowly to join her\n",
      "\n",
      "sisters in the centre of the hall. ‘Why are you standing here?’ she\n",
      "\n",
      "said. ‘Take the basket from the head of this poor porter.’ The\n",
      "\n",
      "provision buyer or housekeeper came \u0000rst, followed by the\n",
      "\n",
      "doorkeeper, and the third girl helped them to lower the basket, after\n",
      "\n",
      "which they emptied out its contents and put everything in its place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they gave the porter two dinars and told him to be o\u0000. For his\n",
      "\n",
      "part, he looked at the lovely girls, the most beautiful he had ever\n",
      "\n",
      "seen, with their equally delightful natures. There were no men with\n",
      "\n",
      "them and, as he stared in astonishment at the wine, the fruits, the\n",
      "\n",
      "scented blossoms and all the rest, he was reluctant to leave. ‘Why\n",
      "\n",
      "don’t you go?’ asked the girl. ‘Do you think that we didn’t pay you\n",
      "\n",
      "enough?’ and with that, she turned to her sister and said: ‘Give him\n",
      "\n",
      "another dinar.’ ‘By God, lady,’ said the porter, ‘it was not that I\n",
      "\n",
      "thought that the payment was too little, for my fee would not come\n",
      "\n",
      "to two dirhams, but you have taken over my heart and soul. How is\n",
      "\n",
      "it that you are alone with no men here and no pleasant companion?\n",
      "\n",
      "You know that there must be four to share a proper feast and\n",
      "\n",
      "women cannot enjoy themselves except with men. As the poet says:\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you not see that four things join for entertainment –\n",
      "\n",
      "Harp, lute, zither and pipe,\n",
      "\n",
      "Matched by four scented \u0000owers –\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose, myrtle, gilly\u0000ower, anemone.\n",
      "\n",
      "These only become pleasant with another four –\n",

      "Wine, gardens, a beloved and some gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three of you and so you need a fourth, who must be a man\n",
      "\n",
      "of intelligence, sensible, clever and one who can keep a secret.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The three girls were surprised by what the porter said, and they\n",
      "\n",
      "laughed at him and asked: ‘Who can produce us a man like that? We\n",
      "\n",
      "are girls and are afraid of entrusting our secrets to someone who\n",
      "\n",
      "would not keep them. We have read in an account what the poet Ibn\n",
      "\n",
      "al-Thumam once said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Guard your secret as you can, entrusting it to none,\n",
      "\n",
      "For if you do, you will have let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your own breast cannot contain your secret,\n",
      "\n",
      "How is it to be held by someone else?\n",
      "\n",
      "And Abu Nuwas has said:\n",

      "Whoever lets the people know his secret\n",
      "\n",
      "Deserves a brand imprinted on his forehead.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When the porter heard what they said, he exclaimed: ‘By God, I\n",
      "\n",
      "am an intelligent and a trustworthy man; I have read books and\n",
      "\n",
      "studied histories; I make public what is good and conceal what is\n",

      "bad. As the poet says:\n",

      "When the girls heard this quotation, they said: ‘You know that\n",
      "\n",
      "we have spent a great deal of money on this place. Do you have\n",
      "\n",
      "anything with you which you can use to pay us back? We shall not\n",
      "\n",
      "let you sit with us as our companion and to look on our comely and\n",

      "beautiful faces until you pay down some money. Have you not\n",

      "heard what the author of the proverb said: “Love without cash is\n",

      "you are someone, but if you have nothing, then go without\n",
      "\n",
      "anything.’ At that point, however, the housekeeper said: ‘Sisters, let\n",
      "\n",
      "him be. For, by God, he has not failed us today, whereas someone\n",
      "\n",
      "else might not have put up with us, and whatever debt he may run\n",
      "\n",
      "up, I will settle for him.’ The porter was delighted and thanked her,\n",
      "\n",
      "kissing the ground, but the girl who had been on the couch said: ‘By\n",
      "\n",
      "God, we shall only let you sit with us on one condition, which is\n",
      "\n",
      "that you ask no questions about what does not concern you, and if\n",
      "\n",
      "you are inquisitive you will be beaten.’ ‘I agree, lady,’ said the\n",

      "wine-jar and brought everything that might be needed. She then\n",
      "\n",
      "brought out the wine-jar and sat down with her two sisters, while\n",
      "\n",
      "the porter, sitting between the three of them, thought he must be\n",

      "dreaming. From the wine-jar that she had fetched she \u0000lled a cup,\n",
      "\n",
      "drank it, and followed it with a second and a third. Then she \u0000lled\n",
      "\n",
      "the cup and passed it to her sister and \u0000nally to the porter. She\n",
      "\n",

      "Wine should be drunk beside a trusted friend,\n",
      "\n",
      "One of pure birth from the line of old heroes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For wine is like the wind, sweet if it passes scented \u0000owers,\n",
      "\n",
      "But stinking if it blows over a corpse.\n",

      "The only blood we are allowed to drink\n",
      "\n",
      "Is blood that comes from grapes.\n",
      "\n",

      "Serve to ransom your gazelle-like eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the housekeeper took the cup, \u0000lled it and gave it to the\n",

      "doorkeeper, who took it from him with thanks and drank it. She\n",
      "\n",
      "then \u0000lled it for the lady of the house, before pouring another cup\n",
      "\n",
      "and passing it to the porter, who kissed the ground in front of her,\n",
      "\n",
      "thanked her and recited:\n",

      "hand and chanted:\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave her old wine, coloured like her cheeks,\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmixed and gleaming like a \u0000ery brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "She kissed it and said, laughingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How can you pour us people’s cheeks?’\n",
      "\n",
      "I said: ‘Drink: this comes from my tears;\n",

      "Its redness is my blood;\n",
      "\n",
      "My breath has heated it within the glass.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied with the line:\n",

      "Companion, if you have wept blood for me,\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour it obediently for me to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then took the cup, drank it and sat down with her sister. They\n",
      "\n",
      "continued to drink, with the porter seated between them, and as\n",
      "\n",
      "they drank, they danced, laughed and sang, reciting poems and\n",
      "\n",
      "lyrics. The porter began to play with them, kissing, biting, rubbing,\n",
      "\n",
      "feeling, touching and taking liberties. One of them would give him\n",
      "\n",
      "morsels to eat, another would cu\u0000 him and slap him, and the third\n",
      "\n",
      "would bring him scented \u0000owers. With them he was enjoying the\n",
      "\n",
      "pleasantest of times, as though he was seated among the houris of\n",

      "Paradise.\n",

      "their heads and their brains. When it had got the upper hand of\n",
      "\n",
      "them, the doorkeeper stood up, stripped o\u0000 her clothes until she\n",
      "\n",
      "was naked, and letting down her hair as a veil, she jumped into the\n",
      "\n",
      "pool. She sported in the water, ducking her head and then spitting\n",
      "\n",
      "out the water, after which she took some in her mouth and spat it\n",
      "\n",
      "over the porter. She washed her limbs and between her thighs, after\n",
      "\n",
      "which she came out from the water and threw herself down on his\n",
      "\n",
      "lap. ‘My master, my darling, what is the name of this?’ she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "pointing to her vagina. ‘Your womb,’ he replied. ‘Oh!’ she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have you no shame?’ and she seized him by the neck and started to\n",
      "\n",
      "cu\u0000 him. ‘Your vagina,’ he said, and she cu\u0000ed him again on the\n",
      "\n",
      "back of his neck, saying: ‘Oh! Oh! How disgusting! Aren’t you\n",
      "\n",
      "ashamed?’ ‘Your vulva,’ he replied. ‘Do you feel no shame for your\n",
      "\n",
      "honour?’ and she struck him a blow with her hand. ‘Your hornet,’ he\n",
      "\n",
      "said, at which the lady of the house pounced on him and beat him,\n",
      "\n",
      "saying: ‘Don’t speak like that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "With every new name that he produced, the girls beat him more\n",
      "\n",
      "and more, until the back of his neck had almost dissolved under\n",
      "\n",
      "their slaps. They were laughing among themselves, until he asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you call it, then?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ replied the\n",
      "\n",
      "doorkeeper. ‘Thank God, I am safe now,’ said the porter. ‘Good for\n",
      "\n",
      "you, mint of the dykes.’ Then the wine was passed round again, and\n",
      "\n",
      "the housekeeper got up, took o\u0000 her clothes and threw herself on to\n",
      "\n",
      "the porter’s lap. ‘What is this called, light of my eyes?’ she asked,\n",
      "\n",
      "pointing at her private parts. ‘Your vagina,’ he said. ‘Oh, how dirty\n",
      "\n",
      "of you!’ she exclaimed, and she struck him a blow that resounded\n",
      "\n",
      "around the hall, adding: ‘Oh! Oh! Have you no shame?’ ‘The mint of\n",
      "\n",
      "the dykes,’ he said, but blows and slaps still rained on the back of\n",
      "\n",
      "his neck. He tried another four names, but the girls kept on saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, no!’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he repeated, and they laughed so\n",
      "\n",
      "much that they fell over backwards. Then they fell to beating his\n",
      "\n",
      "neck, saying: ‘No, that’s not its name.’ He said: ‘O my sisters, what is\n",
      "\n",
      "it called?’ ‘Husked sesame,’ they said. Then the housekeeper put her\n",
      "\n",
      "clothes back on and they sat, drinking together, with the porter\n",
      "\n",
      "groaning at the pain in his neck and shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the wine had been passed round again, the lady of the\n",
      "\n",
      "house, the most beautiful of the three, stood up and stripped o\u0000 her\n",
      "\n",
      "clothes. The porter grasped the back of his neck with his hand and\n",
      "\n",
      "massaged it, saying: ‘My neck and my shoulders are common\n",
      "\n",
      "property.’ When the girl was naked, she jumped into the pool, dived\n",
      "\n",
      "under water, played around and washed herself. To the porter in her\n",
      "\n",
      "nakedness she looked like a sliver of the moon, with a face like the\n",
      "\n",
      "full moon when it rises or the dawn when it breaks. He looked at\n",
      "\n",
      "her \u0000gure, her breasts and her heavy buttocks as they swayed, while\n",
      "\n",
      "she was naked as her Lord had created her. ‘Oh! Oh!’ he said, and\n",
      "\n",
      "he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I compare your \u0000gure to a sappy branch,\n",
      "\n",
      "I load my heart with wrongs and with injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Branches are most beautiful when concealed with leaves,\n",
      "\n",
      "While you are loveliest when we meet you naked.\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing these lines, the girl came out of the pool and sat on\n",
      "\n",
      "the porter’s lap. She pointed at her vulva and said: ‘Little master,\n",
      "\n",
      "what is the name of this?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he replied, and\n",
      "\n",
      "when she exclaimed in disgust, he tried ‘the husked sesame’. ‘Bah!’\n",
      "\n",
      "she said. ‘Your womb,’ he suggested. ‘Oh! Oh! Aren’t you ashamed?’\n",
      "\n",
      "and she slapped the back of his neck. Whatever name he produced,\n",
      "\n",
      "she slapped him, saying: ‘No, no,’ until he asked: ‘Sisters, what is it\n",
      "\n",
      "called?’ ‘The khan of Abu Mansur,’ they replied. ‘Praise God that I\n",
      "\n",
      "have reached safety at last,’ he said. ‘Ho for the khan of Abu\n",
      "\n",
      "Mansur!’ The girl got up and put on her clothes and they all went\n",
      "\n",
      "back to what they had been doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a time the wine circulated among them and the porter then\n",
      "\n",
      "got up, undressed and went into the pool. The girls looked at him\n",
      "\n",
      "swimming in the water and washing under his beard and beneath\n",
      "\n",
      "his armpits, as they had done. Then he came out and threw himself\n",
      "\n",
      "into the lap of the lady of the house, with his arms in the lap of the\n",
      "\n",
      "doorkeeper and his feet and legs in the lap of the girl who had\n",
      "\n",
      "bought the provisions. Then he pointed to his penis and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ladies, what is the name of this?’ They all laughed at this until they\n",
      "\n",
      "fell over backwards. ‘Your zubb,’ one of them suggested. ‘No,’ he\n",
      "\n",
      "said, and he bit each of them. ‘Your air,’ they said, but he repeated\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No’, and embraced each of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",
      "\n",
      "been allowed to say. Then, when it was the tenth night, her sister\n",
      "\n",
      "Dunyazad said: ‘Finish your story.’ ‘With pleasure,’ she replied, and\n",
      "\n",
      "she continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that the girls produced three\n",
      "\n",
      "names for the porter, while he kissed, bit and embraced them until\n",
      "\n",
      "he was satis\u0000ed. They went on laughing until they said: ‘What is its\n",
      "\n",
      "name, then, brother?’ ‘Don’t you know?’ ‘No.’ ‘This is the mule that\n",
      "\n",
      "breaks barriers, browses on the mint of the dykes, eats the husked\n",
      "\n",
      "sesame and that passes the night in the khan of Abu Mansur.’ The\n",
      "\n",
      "girls laughed until they fell over backwards and then they continued\n",
      "\n",
      "with their drinking party, carrying on until nightfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, they told the porter that it was time for him to get\n",
      "\n",
      "up, put on his gaiters and go – ‘Show us the width of your\n",
      "\n",
      "shoulders.’ ‘By God,’ said the porter, ‘if the breath of life were to\n",
      "\n",
      "leave me, it would be easier for me to bear than having to part from\n",
      "\n",
      "you. Let me link night with day, and in the morning we can all go\n",
      "\n",
      "our separate ways.’ The girl who had bought the provisions pleaded\n",
      "\n",
      "with the others: ‘Let him sleep here so that we can laugh at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who knows whether in all our lives we shall meet someone else like\n",
      "\n",
      "him, both wanton and witty.’ They then said: ‘You can only spend\n",
      "\n",
      "the night with us on condition that you accept our authority and\n",
      "\n",
      "that you don’t ask about anything you see or the reason for it.’ The\n",
      "\n",
      "porter agreed to this, and they then told him: ‘Get up and read what\n",
      "\n",
      "is written over the door.’ He went to the door and there he found\n",
      "\n",
      "written above it in gold leaf: ‘Whoever talks about what does not\n",
      "\n",
      "concern him will hear what will not please him.’ ‘I call you to\n",
      "\n",
      "witness,’ he said, ‘that I shall not talk about what is no concern of\n",
      "\n",
      "mine.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper got up and prepared a meal for them, which\n",
      "\n",
      "they ate, and then they lit candles and lamps, dipping ambergris and\n",
      "\n",
      "aloes into the candles. They sat drinking and talking of past loves,\n",
      "\n",
      "after having reset the table with fresh fruits and more wine. They\n",
      "\n",
      "continued for a time, eating, drinking, carousing together over their\n",
      "\n",
      "dessert, laughing and teasing each other, when suddenly there was a\n",
      "\n",
      "knock on the door. This did not disrupt the party, however, and one\n",
      "\n",
      "of the girls went by herself to the door and returned to report: ‘Our\n",
      "\n",
      "happiness is complete tonight.’ ‘How is that?’ the others asked. She\n",
      "\n",
      "told them: ‘At the door are three Persian dervishes, with shaven\n",
      "\n",
      "chins, heads and eyebrows. By a very remarkable coincidence, each\n",
      "\n",
      "of them has lost his left eye. They have only just arrived after a\n",
      "\n",
      "journey; they are showing the signs of travel and this is the \u0000rst\n",
      "\n",
      "time that they have been to our city, Baghdad. They knocked on our\n",
      "\n",
      "door because they couldn’t \u0000nd a lodging for the night and they had\n",
      "\n",
      "said to themselves: “Perhaps the owner of this house would give us\n",
      "\n",
      "the key to a stable or to a hut in which we could pass the night.” For\n",
      "\n",
      "they had been caught out by nightfall, and, being strangers, they\n",
      "\n",
      "had no acquaintance who might give them shelter – and, sisters,\n",
      "\n",
      "each of them is of a ludicrous appearance.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She continued to persuade and cajole until the others agreed to\n",
      "\n",
      "let the Persians come in on condition that they would not talk about\n",
      "\n",
      "what did not concern them lest they hear what would not please\n",
      "\n",
      "them. The girl went o\u0000 joyfully and came back with the three one-\n",
      "\n",
      "eyed men, with shaven beards and moustaches. They spoke words of\n",
      "\n",
      "greeting, bowed and hung back. The girls got up to welcome them\n",
      "\n",
      "and, after congratulating them on their safe arrival, told them to be\n",
      "\n",
      "seated.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the visitors saw was a pleasant and clean room, furnished\n",
      "\n",
      "with greenery, where there were lighted candles, incense rising into\n",

      "the air, dessert, fruits and wine, together with three virgin girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is good, by God,’ they all agreed. Then they turned to the\n",
      "\n",
      "porter and found him cheerfully tired out and drunk. They thought,\n",
      "\n",
      "on seeing him, that he must be one of their own kind and said: ‘This\n",
      "\n",
      "is a dervish like us, either a foreigner or an Arab.’ Hearing this, the\n",
      "\n",
      "porter glowered at them and said: ‘Sit down and don’t be\n",
      "\n",
      "inquisitive. Didn’t you read what is written over the door? It is not\n",
      "\n",
      "for poor men who arrive like you to let loose your tongues at us.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The newcomers apologized submissively, and the girls laughed and\n",
      "\n",
      "made peace between them and the porter, after which food was\n",

      "produced for the new arrivals, which they ate.\n",
      "\n",

      "Heated by wine, they, in their turn, asked for musical instruments\n",
      "\n",
      "and were brought a tambourine, a lute and a Persian harp by the\n",

      "had come down from his palace that night on an excursion to listen\n",

      "to the latest news, accompanied by his vizier, Ja‘far, and Masrur, his\n",

      "had happened to pass that house, where they heard music and\n",

      "singing. He had said to Ja‘far: ‘I want to go in here so that we may\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "is to obey,’ Ja‘far had replied, before going up and knocking on the\n",

      "\n",
      "kissed the ground. ‘Lady,’ he said, ‘we are traders from Tiberias who\n",

      "have been in Baghdad for ten days. We have sold our goods and are\n",

      "by a colleague. We went to his house and, after he had given us a\n",

      "to her sisters and passed on Ja‘far’s message. The others\n",
      "\n",
      "sympathized with the visitors’ plight and told her: ‘Let them in,’\n",

      "seated their visitors and ministered to their needs, saying: ‘Welcome\n",

      "which she poured willow-\u0000ower water, adding some snow and a\n",

      "\n",
      "dervishes were made to sit on a bench on one side of the room and\n",
      "\n",
      "the caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur on a bench on the other side. Then the\n",
      "\n",
      "lady of the house called to the porter: ‘Your friendship does not\n",

      "amount to much. You are not a stranger, but one of the household.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The porter got up, tightened his belt and asked: ‘What do you\n",
      "\n",
      "want?’ ‘Stay where you are,’ she said. Then the housekeeper stood\n",
      "\n",
      "up and set a chair in the middle of the room, opened a cupboard\n",
      "\n",
      "and said to the porter: ‘Come and help me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "In the cupboard he saw two black bitches, with chains around\n",
      "\n",
      "their necks. ‘Take them,’ said the girl, and he took them and\n",
      "\n",
      "brought them to the centre of the room. Then the lady of the house\n",
      "\n",
      "got up, rolled back her sleeves and took up a whip. ‘Bring one of\n",
      "\n",
      "them,’ she told the porter, and he did this, pulling the bitch by its\n",
      "\n",
      "chain, as it whimpered and shook its head at the girl. It howled as\n",
      "\n",
      "she struck it on the head, and she continued to beat it until her arms\n",
      "\n",
      "were tired. She then threw away the whip, pressed the bitch to her\n",

      "breast and wiped away its tears with her hand, kissing its head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she said to the porter: ‘Take this one away and bring the\n",

      "\n",
      "as the \u0000rst.\n",
      "\n",
      "The caliph was concerned and troubled by this. Unable to\n",

      "contain his curiosity about the story of the two bitches, he winked\n",
      "\n",
      "at Ja‘far, but the latter turned to him and gestured to him to remain\n",
      "\n",
      "silent. Then the lady of the house turned to the doorkeeper and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Get up and do your duty.’ ‘Yes,’ she replied and, getting up, she\n",
      "\n",
      "went to the couch, which was made of juniper wood with panels of\n",
      "\n",
      "gold and silver. Then the lady of the house said to the other two\n",
      "\n",
      "girls: ‘Bring out what you have.’ The doorkeeper sat on a chair by\n",
      "\n",
      "her side, while the housekeeper went into a closet and came out\n",
      "\n",
      "with a satin bag with green fringes and two golden discs. She stood\n",
      "\n",
      "in front of the lady of the house, unfastened the bag and took from\n",
      "\n",
      "it a lute whose strings she tuned and whose pegs she tightened, until\n",
      "\n",
      "it was all in order. Then she recited:\n",

      "You are the object of my whole desire;\n",
      "\n",
      "Union with you, beloved, is unending bliss,\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "For through my love, you lead my heart astray.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flowing tears serve to bring my secret out and make it plain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tearful \u0000ood reveals it, and they try\n",
      "\n",
      "To cure the violence of this sickness, but it is you\n",
      "\n",
      "Who are for me both the disease and its cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those whose cure you are, the pains last long.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pine away through the light shed by your eyes,\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is my own love whose sword kills me,\n",
      "\n",
      "A sword that has destroyed many good men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love has no end for me nor can I turn to consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love is my medicine and my code of law;\n",
      "\n",
      "Secretly and openly it serves to adorn me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You bring good fortune to the eye that looks\n",
      "\n",
      "Its \u0000ll on you, or manages a glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and its choice of love distracts my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the lady of the house heard these lines, she cried: ‘Oh! Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!’, tore her clothes and fell to the ground in a faint. The caliph\n",
      "\n",
      "was astonished to see weals caused by the blows of a whip on her\n",

      "\n",
      "When they saw that, all the men present were disturbed, as they had\n",

      "\n",
      "quiet without knowing the truth of the matter and without \u0000nding\n",

      "out about this girl and the two black bitches.’ Ja‘far replied: ‘Master,\n",

      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that the girl laughed in spite of\n",
      "\n",
      "her anger. She then went up to the men and said: ‘Tell me about\n",
      "\n",
      "yourselves, for you have no more than one hour to live, and were\n",
      "\n",
      "you not people of rank, leaders or governors among your peoples,\n",
      "\n",
      "you would not have been so daring.’ ‘Damn you, Ja‘far,’ the caliph\n",
      "\n",
      "said. ‘Tell her about us or else we shall be killed by mistake, and\n",
      "\n",
      "speak softly to her before we become victims of misfortune.’ ‘That is\n",
      "\n",
      "part of what you deserve,’ replied Ja‘far, but the caliph shouted at\n",
      "\n",
      "him: ‘There is a time for joking, but now is when we must be\n",
      "\n",
      "serious.’ The lady then went to the dervishes and asked them\n",
      "\n",
      "whether they were brothers. ‘No, by God,’ they said, ‘we are only\n",
      "\n",
      "faqirs and foreigners.’ She next asked one of them whether he had\n",
      "\n",
      "been born one-eyed. ‘No, by God,’ he said, ‘but I have a strange and\n",
      "\n",
      "wonderful story about the loss of my eye, which, were it written\n",
      "\n",
      "with needles on the inner corners of the eyeballs, would serve as a\n",
      "\n",
      "warning to those who take heed.’ The second and the third dervish,\n",
      "\n",
      "when asked, made the same reply, and they then said: ‘By God,\n",
      "\n",
      "lady, each of us comes from a di\u0000erent country and each is the son\n",
      "\n",
      "of a king and is a ruler over lands and subjects.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned to them and said: ‘Each of you is to tell his story and\n",
      "\n",
      "explain why he came here and he can then touch his forelock and\n",
      "\n",
      "go on his way.’ The \u0000rst to come forward was the porter, who said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Lady, I am a porter and this girl, who bought you your provisions,\n",
      "\n",
      "told me to carry them from the wine seller to the fruiterer, from the\n",

      "\n",
      "know what happened to me with you. This is my story, and that’s all\n",
      "\n",
      "there is.’ The girl laughed and said: ‘Touch your forelock and go.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘By God,’ he said, ‘I am not going to leave until I have heard the\n",

      "\n",
      "SAID:\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady, know that the reason why my chin is shaven and my eye\n",
      "\n",
      "has been plucked out is that my father was a king, who had a\n",
      "\n",
      "brother, also a king, who reigned in another city. His son and I were\n",
      "\n",
      "born on the same day. Years later, when we had grown up, I had got\n",
      "\n",
      "into the habit of visiting my uncle every so often, and I would stay\n",
      "\n",
      "with him for some months. My cousin treated me with the greatest\n",
      "\n",
      "generosity, and would kill sheep for me and pour out wine that he\n",

      "strained for me. Once, when we were sitting drinking and were both\n",
      "\n",
      "under the in\u0000uence of the wine, he said to me: ‘Cousin, there is\n",

      "something that I need from you. Please don’t refuse to do what I\n",
      "\n",
      "want.’ ‘I shall obey you with pleasure,’ I said. After binding me with\n",
      "\n",
      "the most solemn of oaths, he got up straight away and left for a\n",

      "short while. Back he came then with a lady, veiled, perfumed and\n",
      "\n",
      "wearing the most expensive of clothes, who stood behind him as he\n",
      "\n",
      "turned to me and said: ‘Take this woman and go ahead of me to\n",

      "Because of the oath that I had sworn, I could not disobey him or\n",

      "went into the enclosure. While we were sitting there, my cousin\n",
      "\n",
      "arrived with a bowl of water, a bag containing plaster, and a\n",
      "\n",
      "carpenter’s axe. Taking this axe, he went to a tomb in the middle of\n",
      "\n",
      "the enclosure and started to open it up, moving its stones to one\n",
      "\n",
      "side. Then he used the axe to prod about in the soil of the tomb\n",
      "\n",
      "until he uncovered an iron cover the size of a small door. He raised\n",
      "\n",
      "this, revealing beneath it a vaulted staircase. Turning to the woman,\n",
      "\n",
      "he said: ‘Now you can do what you have chosen to do,’ at which she\n",

      "\n",
      "down there myself, I ask you to put back the cover and to replace\n",
      "\n",
      "the soil on top of it as it was before. Use the mortar that is in this\n",
      "\n",
      "bag and the water in the bowl to make a paste and coat the circle of\n",
      "\n",
      "the stones in the enclosure so that it looks as it did before, without\n",
      "\n",
      "anyone being able to say: “The inner part is old but there is a new\n",

      "\n",
      "one but God knows what I have been doing. This is what I need\n",
      "\n",
      "from you.’ He then took his leave of me, wishing me well, and went\n",
      "\n",
      "down the stairs. When he was out of sight, I got up and replaced the\n",

      "thought of what had happened to my cousin the evening before and,\n",
      "\n",
      "when repentance was of no use, I repented of what I had done and\n",

      "of how I had obeyed him. Thinking that it might have been a dream,\n",
      "\n",
      "I started to ask after my cousin, but nobody could tell me where he\n",
      "\n",
      "was. I went out to the cemetery, looking for the enclosure, but I\n",
      "\n",
      "could not \u0000nd it. I kept on going round enclosure after enclosure\n",
      "\n",
      "and grave after grave until nightfall, but I still failed in my search. I\n",
      "\n",
      "returned to the palace, but I could neither eat nor drink, for my\n",
      "\n",
      "thoughts were taken up with my cousin, as I did not know how he\n",
      "\n",
      "was, and I was intensely distressed. I passed a troubled night until\n",
      "\n",
      "morning came, when I went for a second time to the cemetery,\n",
      "\n",
      "thinking over what my cousin had done and regretting that I had\n",
      "\n",
      "listened to him. I went round all the enclosures but, to my regret, I\n",

      "misgivings increased until I was almost driven mad. The only relief I\n",

      "could \u0000nd was to leave and go back to my father, but as soon as I\n",
      "\n",
      "reached the gate of his city, I was attacked by a group of men who\n",

      "\n",
      "myself: ‘What can have happened to my father?’ I asked my captors\n",

      "why they were doing this. At \u0000rst they did not answer, but after a\n",

      "\n",
      "my captors now brought me. I had been passionately fond of\n",
      "\n",
      "shooting with a pellet bow and the quarrel arose from this. One day\n",
      "\n",
      "when I was standing on the roof of my palace, a bird settled on the\n",
      "\n",
      "roof of the palace of the vizier. I intended to shoot it, but the pellet\n",
      "\n",
      "missed and, as had been decreed by fate, it struck out the eye of the\n",
      "\n",
      "vizier. This was like the proverb expressed in the old lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked with a pace that was decreed for us,\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is how those under fate’s control must walk.\n",

      "enemy. When I now stood before him with my hands tied, he\n",

      "ordered my head to be cut o\u0000. ‘For what crime do you kill me?’ I\n",

      "missing eye. ‘I did that by accident,’ I protested. ‘If you did it by\n",

      "and foot. He was about to bandage my eyes before going on to kill\n",
      "\n",
      "me, but I wept so bitterly that I moved him to tears. Then, looking\n",
      "\n",
      "at him, I recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought of you as a strong coat of mail\n",

      "To guard me from the arrows of my foes,\n",

      "\n",
      "At least your silence neither hurts me nor helps them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also other lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought my brothers were a coat of mail;\n",
      "\n",
      "They were, but this was for the enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought of them as deadly shafts;\n",
      "\n",
      "They were, but their points pierced my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioner had been in my father’s service and I had done\n",
      "\n",
      "him favours, so when he heard these lines, he said: ‘Master, what\n",
      "\n",
      "can I do? I am a slave under command.’ But then he added: ‘Keep\n",

      "your life, but don’t come back to this land or else you will be killed\n",
      "\n",
      "and you will destroy me, together with yourself. As one of the poets\n",

      "\n",
      "travelled to my uncle’s city and, after presenting myself to him, I\n",
      "\n",

      "At that, I could no longer stay silent about the a\u0000air of my\n",

      "with \u0000our, grain, eatables and so on, and there in the middle of it\n",

      "in an embrace, but they had become black charcoal, as though they\n",

      "this damned ‘ifrit was torturing her, how she had been there for\n",

      "consequence of what you have done.’ Then he took the sword and\n",

      "\n",
      "when she was twelve years old and she has known no one but me. I\n",

      "used to visit her for one night in every ten in the shape of a Persian.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was sure that she had betrayed me, I killed her. As for you, I\n",

      "to transform you into,’ he said, ‘that of a dog, an ass or an ape.’ I\n",
      "\n",
      "was hoping that he would forgive me and so I said: ‘By God, if you\n",
      "\n",
      "forgive me, God will forgive you, because you have spared a Muslim\n",

      "who has done you no harm.’ I went on to implore him with the\n",

      "greatest humility, and, standing before him, I cried: ‘I am wronged.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t talk so much,’ he said. ‘I am not far from killing you, but I\n",

      "will give you one chance.’ ‘Forgiveness be\u0000ts you better, ‘ifrit,’ I\n",
      "\n",
      "said, ‘so forgive me as the envied forgive the envier.’ ‘How was\n",
      "\n",
      "that?’ he asked, AND I REPLIED:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is said, O ‘ifrit, that in a certain city there were two men living\n",
      "\n",
      "in two houses joined by a connecting wall. One of these two envied\n",
      "\n",
      "the other and because of this he used the evil eye against him and\n",
      "\n",
      "did all he could to injure him. So far did this envy increase that the\n",
      "\n",
      "envier lost appetite and no longer enjoyed the pleasure of sleep,\n",
      "\n",
      "while the man whom he envied grew more and more prosperous,\n",
      "\n",
      "and the more the envier tried to gain the upper hand, the more the\n",
      "\n",
      "other’s prosperity increased and spread. On hearing of his\n",
      "\n",
      "neighbour’s envy and of his attempts to injure him, he moved away\n",
      "\n",
      "from the district, leaving the country and saying: ‘By God, I shall\n",
      "\n",
      "abandon worldly things for his sake.’ He settled in another city and\n",
      "\n",
      "bought a piece of land there in which was a well with an old water\n",
      "\n",
      "wheel. On this land he endowed a small mosque for which he\n",
      "\n",
      "bought everything that was needed, and there he devoted himself\n",
      "\n",
      "with all sincerity to the worship of Almighty God. Faqirs and the\n",
      "\n",
      "poor \u0000ocked there from every quarter, and his fame spread in that\n",
      "\n",
      "city until eventually his envious neighbour heard how he had\n",
      "\n",
      "prospered and how the leading citizens would go to visit him. So he\n",
      "\n",
      "came to the mosque where the object of his envy gave him a warm\n",
      "\n",
      "welcome and showed him the greatest honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The envier then said: ‘I have something to tell you and this is\n",
      "\n",
      "why I have made the journey to see you. So get up and come with\n",
      "\n",
      "me.’ The other did this and, taking the envier’s hand, he walked to\n",
      "\n",
      "the farthest end of the mosque. ‘Tell the faqirs to go to their rooms,’\n",
      "\n",
      "said the envier, ‘for I can only speak to you in private where no one\n",
      "\n",
      "can hear us.’ This the envied did, and the faqirs went to their rooms\n",
      "\n",
      "as they were told. The two then walked on a little until they came to\n",
      "\n",
      "the old well and there the envier pushed his victim into it without\n",
      "\n",
      "anyone knowing. He himself then left the mosque and went on his\n",
      "\n",
      "way, thinking that he had killed his former neighbour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The well, however, was inhabited by jinn, who caught the falling\n",
      "\n",
      "man and lowered him gently on to the bedrock. They then asked\n",
      "\n",
      "each other whether any of them knew who he was. Most said no,\n",
      "\n",
      "but one of them said: ‘This is the man who \u0000ed from his envier and\n",
      "\n",
      "who settled in this city where he founded this mosque. We have\n",
      "\n",
      "listened with delight to his invocations and to his reading of the\n",
      "\n",
      "Quran. The envier travelled to meet him and by a trick threw him\n",
      "\n",
      "down into our midst. But news of him has reached the king, who is\n",
      "\n",
      "intending to visit him tomorrow on the matter of his daughter.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is wrong with his daughter?’ asked one of the jinn. ‘She is\n",
      "\n",
      "possessed by an evil spirit,’ replied the other, ‘for the jinni Marwan\n",
      "\n",
      "ibn Damdam is in love with her. If this man knew how to treat her,\n",
      "\n",
      "he could cure her, for the treatment is the easiest possible.’ ‘What is\n",
      "\n",
      "it?’ asked the other. ‘The black cat that he has with him in the\n",
      "\n",
      "mosque has a white spot as big as a dirham at the end of its tail. If\n",
      "\n",
      "he takes seven of its white hairs and uses them to fumigate the girl,\n",
      "\n",
      "the evil spirit will leave her head and never return and she will be\n",
      "\n",
      "cured there and then.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was listening to all this, and so it was that the next\n",
      "\n",
      "morning, when dawn broke and the faqirs came, they found the\n",
      "\n",
      "shaikh rising out of the well, and as a result he became a \u0000gure of\n",
      "\n",
      "awe to them. Since he had no other medicines, he took seven hairs\n",
      "\n",
      "from the white spot at the end of the black cat’s tail and carried\n",
      "\n",
      "them away with him. The sun had scarcely risen when the king\n",
      "\n",
      "arrived with his escort and his great o\u0000cers of state. He told his\n",
      "\n",
      "men to wait and went in to visit the shaikh, who welcomed him\n",
      "\n",
      "warmly and said: ‘Shall I tell you why you have come to me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Please do,’ replied the king. The man said: ‘You have come to visit\n",
      "\n",
      "me in order to ask me about your daughter.’ ‘That is true, good\n",
      "\n",
      "shaikh,’ the king agreed. ‘Send someone to fetch her,’ said the man,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘and I hope, if God Almighty wills it, that she will be cured\n",
      "\n",
      "immediately.’ The king gladly sent for his daughter, who was\n",
      "\n",
      "brought tied up and manacled. The man sat her down and spread a\n",
      "\n",
      "curtain over her, after which he produced the seven cat hairs and\n",
      "\n",
      "used them to fumigate her. The evil spirit that was in her head cried\n",
      "\n",
      "out and left. She then recovered her senses, covered her face and\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘What is all this? Who has brought me here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The joy that the king felt was not to be surpassed. He kissed his\n",
      "\n",
      "daughter’s eyes and then the hands of the shaikh, after which he\n",
      "\n",
      "turned to his state o\u0000cials and said: ‘What do you say? What does\n",
      "\n",
      "the man who cured my daughter deserve?’ ‘He should marry her,’\n",
      "\n",
      "they said. ‘You are right,’ said the king, and he married the man to\n",
      "\n",
      "his daughter, making him his son-in-law. Shortly afterwards, the\n",
      "\n",
      "vizier died and when the king asked who should replace him, the\n",
      "\n",
      "courtiers said: ‘Your son-in-law.’ So he was appointed vizier and\n",
      "\n",
      "when, soon after that, the king himself died and people asked who\n",
      "\n",
      "should be made king, the answer was: ‘The vizier.’ Accordingly he\n",
      "\n",
      "was enthroned and ruled as king.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, as he was riding out, the envier happened to be passing\n",
      "\n",
      "by and saw the man he envied in his imperial state among his emirs,\n",
      "\n",
      "viziers and o\u0000cers of state. The king’s eye fell on him and, turning\n",
      "\n",
      "to one of his viziers, he said: ‘Bring me that man, but do not alarm\n",
      "\n",
      "him.’ When his envious neighbour was brought to him, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Give this man a thousand mithqals of gold from my treasury; load\n",
      "\n",
      "twenty camels for him with trade goods, and send a guard with him\n",
      "\n",
      "to escort him to his land.’ Then he took his leave of the man who\n",
      "\n",
      "envied him, turned away from him and did not punish him for what\n",
      "\n",
      "he had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘See then, ‘ifrit, how the envied forgave the envious, who had started\n",
      "\n",
      "by envying him, then injured him, followed him, and eventually\n",
      "\n",
      "threw him into the well, intending to kill him. His victim did not\n",
      "\n",
      "pay him back for these injuries but forgave and pardoned him.’ At\n",
      "\n",
      "this point, lady, I wept most bitterly before him and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Forgive those who do wrong, for the wise man\n",
      "\n",
      "Forgives wrongdoers for their evil deeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "If every fault is mine,\n",
      "\n",
      "Every forgiveness should be yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who hopes that his superior will pardon him\n",
      "\n",
      "Has to forgive inferiors their faults.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ‘ifrit said: ‘I shall not kill you, but neither shall I forgive you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, I shall cast a spell on you.’ Then he plucked me from the\n",
      "\n",
      "ground and \u0000ew up into the air with me until I could see the earth\n",
      "\n",
      "looking like a bowl set in the middle of water. He set me down on a\n",
      "\n",
      "mountain and, taking some earth, he muttered over it, cast a spell\n",
      "\n",
      "and scattered it over me, saying: ‘Leave this shape of yours and\n",

      "\n",
      "when I saw myself in this ugly form, I wept over my plight, but I\n",
      "\n",
      "had to endure Time’s tyranny, knowing that no one is Time’s\n",

      "which will be a man of brass – but not the one whom you shot. He\n",

      "will come to you with an oar in his hand and you must board his\n",
      "\n",
      "boat, but you are not to pronounce the Name of Almighty God. The\n",

      "a closet, he came back carrying on his head ten trays, each with a\n",

      "lit ten candles, \u0000xing one to each tray, and removed the covers.\n",
      "\n",
      "There beneath the covers on the trays was nothing but ashes and\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Young men,’ I said, ‘you must satisfy my concern and tell me why it\n",

      "that they tell me. ‘This will go hard with you,’ they replied, ‘as you\n",

      "and sew it up. They went on: ‘A bird called a rukh will swoop on\n",

      "you should slit open the skin and come out. The bird will be scared\n",

      "mountain top. I got out of the skin and walked on until I reached\n",
      "\n",
      "the palace, where I found forty girls, beautiful as moons, at whom\n",
      "\n",
      "no one could tire of looking. On seeing me, they all greeted me\n",
      "\n",
      "warmly. ‘We have been expecting you for a month,’ they said, ‘and\n",

      "praise be to God Who has brought us one who deserves us and\n",
      "\n",
      "whom we deserve.’ They seated me on a high dais and said: ‘Today\n",
      "\n",
      "you are our lord and master and we are your slave girls, under your\n",
      "\n",
      "command, so give us your orders.’ I was astonished by all this, but\n",
      "\n",
      "they brought me food and we ate together, after which they fetched\n",
      "\n",
      "drink. They clustered around me and \u0000ve of them spread out a mat\n",
      "\n",
      "around which they set out quantities of scented \u0000owers, together\n",
      "\n",
      "with fruits, fresh and dried. Then they brought wine and we sat\n",
      "\n",
      "down to drink as they sang to the music of the lute.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine circulated and such was my delight that I forgot all\n",
      "\n",
      "worldly cares. ‘This is the life,’ I said, and I stayed with them until it\n",
      "\n",
      "was time to sleep. ‘Take whichever of us you choose to sleep with\n",
      "\n",
      "you,’ they said. So I took one of them, with a beautiful face, dark\n",
      "\n",
      "eyes, black hair, well-spaced teeth, perfect in all aspects, with\n",
      "\n",
      "joining eyebrows, like a supple bough or a sprig of sweet basil,\n",
      "\n",
      "astonishing and amazing the mind. As the poet has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "It shows ignorance to compare her to a tender branch,\n",
      "\n",
      "And how far is she unlike a gazelle!\n",
      "\n",
      "How can the dear gazelle have a form like hers\n",
      "\n",
      "Or honeyed lips like hers – how sweet a drink –\n",
      "\n",
      "Or her wide eyes, that act as murderers,\n",
      "\n",
      "Capturing the desperate lover, tortured and then slain?\n",
      "\n",
      "I yearn for her; mine is a heathen love;\n",
      "\n",
      "No wonder that the lovesick is in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recited to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "My eyes see nothing but your loveliness;\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from you no thought enters my heart,\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In your love is my death and my rebirth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then got up and spent a night of unsurpassed pleasure sleeping\n",
      "\n",
      "with her. In the morning, the girls took me to the baths, washed me\n",
      "\n",
      "and gave me the most splendid of clothes to wear. Then they\n",
      "\n",
      "brought out food and drink and we ate and drank, the wine\n",
      "\n",
      "circulating until nightfall. This time I chose another lovely, pliant\n",
      "\n",
      "girl. As the poet describes:\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw upon her breast two caskets sealed with musk,\n",
      "\n",
      "Withheld from any lover’s grasp,\n",
      "\n",
      "Guarded with arrows she shoots from her eyes –\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrows that strike down any who attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "I passed the most delightful of nights, sleeping with her until dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, my lady, I spent a whole year with these girls, enjoying a\n",
      "\n",
      "carefree life, but as the next year began, they said: ‘Would that we\n",
      "\n",
      "had never known you, but if you listen to us you can save yourself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They then started to weep and when I asked them what the matter\n",
      "\n",
      "was, they explained: ‘We are the daughters of kings, and we have\n",
      "\n",
      "been gathered together here for a period of years. We go away for\n",
      "\n",
      "forty days and then stay here for a year, eating, drinking, enjoying\n",
      "\n",
      "ourselves and taking our pleasure, after which we go o\u0000 again. This\n",
      "\n",
      "is our custom and we are afraid that when we leave you, you will\n",
      "\n",
      "not do what we tell you. Here are the keys of the palace, which we\n",
      "\n",
      "are handing over to you. In the palace are forty rooms, thirty-nine of\n",
      "\n",
      "which you may enter, but you must take care not to open the door\n",
      "\n",
      "of the fortieth, or else you will be forced to leave us.’ ‘If that is so,’ I\n",
      "\n",
      "said, ‘then I shall certainly not open it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "One of them then came to me, embraced me, wept and recited\n",
      "\n",
      "the lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "If after separation we come close again,\n",
      "\n",
      "The frown upon Time’s face will turn into a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a sight of you serves as kohl for my eyes,\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall forgive Time all its evil deeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "When she came close to say farewell, she and her heart\n",
      "\n",
      "Were allies there to longing and to love.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wept moist pearls, while my tears, as they \u0000owed,\n",
      "\n",
      "Were like carnelians, forming a necklace on her breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "On seeing the girls’ tears, I swore that I would never open the\n",
      "\n",
      "forbidden room, and after I had said goodbye, they went outside\n",
      "\n",
      "and \u0000ew away. So I sat in the palace by myself and when evening\n",
      "\n",
      "approached, I opened the door to the \u0000rst chamber and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "There I found a virtual paradise, a garden with green trees, ripe\n",
      "\n",
      "fruits, tuneful birds and gushing waters. I felt at rest as I walked\n",
      "\n",
      "among the trees, smelling sweet-scented \u0000owers and listening to the\n",
      "\n",
      "song of the birds as they glori\u0000ed the One God, the Omnipotent. I\n",
      "\n",
      "looked at apples whose colour was midway between red and yellow,\n",
      "\n",
      "as the poet has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "An apple’s nature has combined two shades –\n",
      "\n",
      "The beloved’s cheek and the complexion of the timorous\n",
      "\n",
      "lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I looked at quinces that put to shame the scent of musk and\n",
      "\n",
      "ambergris, as the poet has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the quince are all mankind’s delights;\n",
      "\n",
      "Its fame surpasses every other fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its taste is wine and its scent di\u0000used musk,\n",
      "\n",
      "Golden in colour, shaped like the full moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then looked at apricots whose beauty delighted the eye like\n",
      "\n",
      "polished rubies, and after that I left the chamber and locked the\n",
      "\n",
      "door again. Next day I opened the door to the second chamber, went\n",
      "\n",
      "in and found a large space, with date palms and a \u0000owing stream\n",
      "\n",
      "whose banks were carpeted with rose bushes, jasmine, marjoram,\n",
      "\n",
      "eglantine, narcissus and gilly\u0000owers. Breezes passed over these\n",
      "\n",
      "scented \u0000owers and the scent spread in all directions, \u0000lling me\n",
      "\n",
      "with perfect happiness. I left this chamber, locked the door behind\n",
      "\n",
      "me and opened the third. Here I found a hall, paved with coloured\n",
      "\n",
      "marble, valuable minerals and precious stones. In it were cages of\n",
      "\n",
      "sandalwood and aloes wood, with singing birds, such as the\n",
      "\n",
      "nightingale, the ringdove, blackbirds, turtledoves and the Nubian\n",
      "\n",
      "song thrush. I was delighted by this; my cares were dispelled and I\n",
      "\n",
      "slept there until morning. Then I opened the fourth door to discover\n",
      "\n",
      "a large chamber with forty closets whose doors were standing open.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went in and saw an indescribable quantity of pearls, sapphires,\n",
      "\n",
      "topazes, emeralds and other precious stones. In my astonishment I\n",
      "\n",
      "exclaimed: ‘I do not think that there is a single king who has all this\n",
      "\n",
      "in his treasury.’ Joy \u0000lled me, my cares leaving me, and I said: ‘I am\n",
      "\n",
      "the supreme ruler of the age; my wealth is a gift granted me by\n",
      "\n",
      "God’s grace; the forty girls are under my authority, and they have\n",
      "\n",
      "no other man besides me.’ I went from place to place until thirty-\n",
      "\n",
      "nine days had passed, during which time I had opened all the rooms\n",
      "\n",
      "except for the one whose door I had been told not to open.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one, which made the number up to forty, preoccupied me\n",
      "\n",
      "and, in order to bring me misery, Satan incited me to open it. I\n",
      "\n",
      "could not hold out against this, and so with only one day left before\n",
      "\n",
      "the girls were due to return, I went to the chamber, opened the door\n",
      "\n",
      "and went in. I found a fragrance the like of which I had never smelt\n",
      "\n",
      "before. It overcame my senses and I fell down in a faint, which\n",
      "\n",
      "lasted for an hour. Then I plucked up my courage and went further\n",
      "\n",
      "into the room, whose \u0000oor I found spread with sa\u0000ron. Light was\n",
      "\n",
      "given by lamps of gold and candles from which was di\u0000used the\n",
      "\n",
      "scent of musk and ambergris, and I saw two huge censers, each\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000lled with aloes wood, ambergris and honeyed perfume whose scent\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000lled the room. I saw a horse, black as darkest night, in front of\n",
      "\n",
      "which was a manger of clear crystal, \u0000lled with husked sesame,\n",
      "\n",
      "together with a similar manger \u0000lled with rosewater scented with\n",
      "\n",
      "musk. The horse was harnessed and bridled and its saddle was of\n",
      "\n",
      "red gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I saw this, I was astonished and said to myself: ‘There must\n",
      "\n",
      "be something of great importance here.’ Satan led me further astray\n",
      "\n",
      "and so I took hold of the horse and mounted it. It didn’t move and\n",
      "\n",
      "so I kicked it, and when it still refused to move, I took the whip and\n",
      "\n",
      "struck it. As soon as it felt the blow, it neighed with a sound like\n",
      "\n",
      "rumbling thunder and, opening up a pair of wings, it \u0000ew o\u0000 with\n",
      "\n",
      "me, carrying me up into the sky way above the ground. After a time,\n",
      "\n",
      "it set me down on a \u0000at roof and whisked its tail across my face,\n",
      "\n",
      "striking out my right eye and causing it to slide down my cheek. It\n",
      "\n",
      "then left me and I came down from the roof to \u0000nd the ten one-eyed\n",
      "\n",
      "youths. ‘No welcome to you,’ they said. ‘Here I am,’ I replied. ‘I have\n",
      "\n",
      "become like you, and I want you to give me a tray of grime with\n",
      "\n",
      "which to blacken my face and to let me sit with you.’ ‘No, by God,’\n",
      "\n",
      "they said, ‘you may not do that. Get out!’\n",
      "\n",
      "They drove me away, leaving me in dire straits, thinking over the\n",
      "\n",
      "misfortunes that had overtaken me. I was sad at heart and tearful\n",
      "\n",
      "when I parted from them, and I said to myself in a low voice: ‘I was\n",
      "\n",
      "resting at my ease, but my inquisitiveness would not leave me.’ So I\n",
      "\n",
      "shaved o\u0000 my beard and whiskers and wandered from place to\n",

      "place. God decreed that I should remain safe and I reached Baghdad\n",

      "yesterday evening, where I found these two men standing in\n",

      "perplexity. I greeted them and introduced myself as a stranger. ‘We\n",
      "\n",
      "too are strangers,’ they said, so we agreed to go together, all of us\n",
      "\n",
      "being dervishes and all being blind in the right eye. This, lady, is\n",
      "\n",
      "why I am clean shaven and have lost my eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You can touch your forelock and go,’ she told him, but he replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not before I have heard what these other people have to say.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady of the house then turned to the caliph, Ja‘far and\n",
      "\n",
      "Masrur and said: ‘Tell me your story.’ Ja‘far came forward and told\n",
      "\n",
      "her the story that he had told to the doorkeeper when they entered\n",

      "and when she heard this, she allowed them all to leave. In the lane\n",

      "threaded our way through the markets, we discovered that the\n",

      "forti\u0000ed, and I then entered the royal apartments, where all the\n",

      "utensils were made of gold and silver. There I saw the king wearing\n",
      "\n",
      "robes of bewildering splendour, seated with his chamberlains,\n",
      "\n",
      "o\u0000cers and viziers. When I approached, I found that he was sitting\n",
      "\n",
      "on a throne studded with pearls and gems, wearing cloth of gold,\n",
      "\n",
      "with every jewel gleaming like a star. Standing around him were\n",

      "\u0000fty mamluks, dressed in silks of various kinds, with drawn swords\n",
      "\n",
      "in their stone hands – an astonishing sight. I then walked into the\n",
      "\n",
      "hall of the harem, whose walls were covered with hangings of silk\n",
      "\n",
      "with gold-embroidered branches. The queen was there asleep,\n",
      "\n",
      "wearing a robe ornamented with fresh pearls. On her head was a\n",
      "\n",
      "crown studded with gemstones of all kinds, while around her neck\n",
      "\n",
      "were necklaces of all sorts. Everything she was wearing, dress and\n",

      "ornaments, was unchanged, but she herself had been transformed to\n",
      "\n",
      "black stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then found an open door and went up to it. There were seven\n",

      "steps and these led to a chamber whose marble \u0000oor was spread\n",
      "\n",
      "with gold-embroidered carpets. In it there was a couch made of\n",
      "\n",
      "juniper wood, inset with pearls and precious stones, together with\n",
      "\n",
      "two large emeralds, covered by a pearl-studded hanging. There was\n",

      "also a door from which I could see a light shining. I went to stand\n",
      "\n",
      "over it and there in the centre on a small chair I found a jewel the\n",

      "size of a duck’s egg, burning like a candle and shedding light, while\n",
      "\n",
      "spread over the couch was an amazing array of silks. The sight \u0000lled\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Someone must have lit these,’ I said to myself, and I then went to\n",

      "another room and proceeded to search all through the building,\n",

      "\n",
      "a coverlet, trying in vain to sleep but becoming uneasy. Then at\n",
      "\n",
      "midnight I heard a beautiful voice reciting the Quran. This \u0000lled me\n",
      "\n",
      "with joy and I followed the sound until I came to a small room\n",
      "\n",
      "whose door was shut. I opened it and looked inside, to \u0000nd a chapel\n",
      "\n",
      "with a prayer niche in which hung lighted lamps together with two\n",
      "\n",
      "candles. In this chapel a prayer rug had been put down and on this\n",

      "sat a handsome young man with, before him, a copy of the holy\n",

      "\n",
      "Wondering how he alone had been saved from out of all the\n",

      "inhabitants of the city, I entered and greeted him. He looked up and\n",
      "\n",
      "returned my greeting, at which I said: ‘By the truth of what you\n",

      "have recited from the Book of God, I implore you to answer my\n",

      "you tell me why you came here and I will tell you what happened to\n",
      "\n",
      "me and the people of this city and how it was that I escaped.’ So I\n",
      "\n",
      "told him my story, which \u0000lled him with wonder, and then I asked\n",
      "\n",
      "him about the townspeople. ‘Wait, sister,’ he said, and he then\n",
      "\n",
      "closed the Quran and put it into a bag of satin, before making me sit\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "that he was a youth whose father had died, leaving him a huge\n",

      "shortly afterwards. We talked with them, brought them in and\n",

      "\n",
      "for this breach and asked them all for their stories, which they\n",

      "even if she were on the far side of Mount Qaf.’ The caliph asked her\n",
      "\n",
      "to produce the lock of hair, which she did, and he then took a single\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "palace was rocked by a tremor; there was a sound like a peal of\n",
      "\n",
      "thunder and there stood the lady. As she was a Muslim, she greeted\n",
      "\n",
      "the caliph, who replied: ‘Peace be on you and the mercy and\n",

      "blessings of God.’ ‘Know,’ she went on, ‘that this girl sowed the seed\n",

      "you now want them to be set free, Commander of the Faithful, I\n",

      "her wealth – someone who is your closest relation.’ She then took a\n",
      "\n",
      "bowl of water, cast a spell over it and recited some unintelligible\n",

      "words. She sprinkled water on the faces of the two bitches and said:\n",

      "going to kill her, but for fear of God he beat her instead and sent her\n",

      "\n",
      "the elder was Shams al-Din Muhammad, while the younger was Nur\n",

      "placing it in the wrapper of his turban, all the while shedding tears\n",
      "\n",
      "at the thought of being parted from his father while he himself was\n",
      "\n",
      "still young. Nur al-Din then said: ‘I give you \u0000ve injunctions. The\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000rst is: do not be on intimate terms with anyone, for in this way you\n",
      "\n",
      "will be safe from the evil they may do you. Safety lies in seclusion,\n",
      "\n",
      "so do not be too familiar with anyone. I have heard what the poet\n",
      "\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no one in this age of yours for whose friendship you\n",
      "\n",
      "can hope;\n",
      "\n",
      "When Time is harsh to you, no friend will stay faithful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Live alone and choose no one in whom to trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, then, is my advice; it is enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second injunction, my son, is to injure no man, lest Time injure\n",
      "\n",
      "you, for one day it will favour you and the next day it will harm\n",
      "\n",
      "you, and this world is a loan to be repaid. I have heard what the\n",
      "\n",
      "poet says:\n",
      "\n",
      "Act slowly; do not rush to what you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be merciful and be known for your mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "No power surpasses that of God,\n",
      "\n",
      "And every wrongdoer will be oppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third injunction is to keep silent and to concern yourself with\n",
      "\n",
      "your own faults and not with those of others. The saying goes:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whoever stays silent, escapes,” and I have heard the poet say:\n",
      "\n",
      "Silence is an adornment which a\u0000ords you safety,\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you speak, refrain from babble.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you regret your silence once,\n",
      "\n",
      "You will regret having spoken many times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth injunction, my son, is this: be on your guard against\n",
      "\n",
      "drinking wine, for wine is the root of all discord and it carries away\n",
      "\n",
      "men’s wits, so I repeat, guard against it. I have heard the poet say:\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave up drinking wine and have become\n",
      "\n",
      "A source of guidance for its censurers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink makes the drunken stray from the right path,\n",
      "\n",
      "And opens the door to evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \u0000fth injunction is this: guard your wealth and it will guard you;\n",
      "\n",
      "protect it and it will protect you. Do not overspend or you will \u0000nd\n",
      "\n",
      "yourself in need of help from the most insigni\u0000cant people. Look\n",
      "\n",
      "after your money, for it will be a salve for your wounds. I have\n",
      "\n",
      "heard the poet say:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I lack money, then I have no friends,\n",
      "\n",
      "But all men are my friends when I have wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many friends have helped me spend,\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the money went, they all deserted me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Nur al-Din went on delivering his injunctions to Hasan until his\n",
      "\n",
      "soul left his body, after which Hasan stayed at home mourning for\n",
      "\n",
      "him, with the sultan and all the emirs joining in his grief. His\n",
      "\n",
      "mourning extended for two months after the funeral, during which\n",
      "\n",
      "time he did not ride out, attend court or present himself before the\n",
      "\n",
      "sultan. This earned him the sultan’s anger, as a result of which one\n",
      "\n",
      "of the chamberlains was appointed vizier in his place, with orders to\n",
      "\n",
      "set his seal on Nur al-Din’s properties, wealth, buildings and\n",
      "\n",
      "possessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new vizier set out to do this and to arrest Hasan and take\n",
      "\n",
      "him to the sultan to deal with the young man as he saw \u0000t. Among\n",
      "\n",
      "his soldiers was one of the dead vizier’s mamluks, and when he\n",
      "\n",
      "heard what was about to happen, he quickly rode to Hasan, and\n",
      "\n",
      "found him sitting by the door of his house, broken-hearted and with\n",
      "\n",
      "his head bowed in sorrow. The mamluk dismounted, kissed his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "and said: ‘My master and son of my master, quick, quick, run away\n",
      "\n",
      "before you are doomed.’ ‘What is the matter?’ asked Hasan,\n",
      "\n",
      "trembling. ‘The sultan is angry with you and has ordered your\n",
      "\n",
      "arrest,’ replied the mamluk. ‘Misfortune is hot on my heels, so \u0000ee\n",
      "\n",
      "for your life.’ ‘Is there time for me to go inside to fetch some money\n",
      "\n",
      "to help me in exile?’ Hasan asked. ‘Get up now, master,’ urged the\n",
      "\n",
      "mamluk, ‘and leave at once.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So Hasan got up, reciting these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you meet injustice, save your life\n",
      "\n",
      "And let the house lament its builders.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can replace the country that you lose,\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no replacement for your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Send out no messenger on any grave a\u0000air,\n",
      "\n",
      "For only you yourself will give you good advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lion’s neck is only thick\n",
      "Because it looks after all its own a\u0000airs.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, heeding the mamluk’s warning, he covered his head with the\n",
      "\n",
      "skirt of his robe and walked o\u0000 until he got outside the city. He\n",
      "\n",

      "radiantly in the candlelight, and he looked at the red satin dress that\n",

      "Where did you sleep last night?’ ‘By God,’ replied Hasan, ‘I slept last\n",

      "bridegroom in Egypt.’ ‘Maybe you were dreaming,’ they said, ‘and it\n",

      "was in your dream that you saw this.’ Hasan thought it over to\n",

      "been an artful fellow, that is to say, a thief, but had been led to\n",
      "\n",
      "repent of his evil-doing by God, after which he had opened a\n",

      "his shop, they dispersed in fear. The cook, looking at Hasan’s grace\n",

      "and beauty, felt a\u0000ection for him enter his heart. ‘Where have you\n",

      "‘But, my son,’ he added, ‘keep this a\u0000air concealed until God\n",
      "\n",
      "relieves your distress. Stay with me here, and I shall take you as a\n",
      "\n",
      "son, for I have none of my own.’ Hasan agreed to this and the cook\n",
      "\n",
      "went to the market and bought \u0000ne material for him, with which he\n",

      "clothed him. The two of them went o\u0000 to the qadi and Hasan\n",

      "days had passed, there was still no news of him. So Shams al-Din\n",

      "and-such a hanging there, and so on, including everything in the\n",
      "\n",
      "house. He then folded the paper and gave orders for all Hasan’s\n",
      "\n",
      "things to be collected. He took the turban, the tarboosh, the mantle\n",
      "\n",

      "to the nurses, naming him ‘Ajib. In one day he grew as much as\n",
      "\n",
      "other children grow in a month, and in a month as much as they do\n",
      "\n",
      "in a year. When he was seven years old, he was handed over to a\n",
      "\n",
      "teacher who was told to give him a good education and to teach him\n",
      "\n",
      "to read. He stayed at school for four years, but he began to \u0000ght\n",
      "\n",
      "with the other children and abuse them, saying: ‘Which of you is my\n",
      "\n",
      "equal? I am the son of Shams al-Din of Egypt.’ The other children\n",
      "\n",
      "went together to the monitor to complain of his rough behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The monitor told them: ‘When he arrives tomorrow, I’ll teach you\n",

      "\n",
      "taking note of how extremely handsome he was, his heart beat fast,\n",
      "\n",
      "blood sensed the pull of blood, and he felt linked to the boy by\n",
      "\n",
      "a\u0000ection. He happened to have cooked a dish of sugared\n",
      "\n",
      "pomegranate seeds and as God had inspired him with love for his\n",
      "\n",
      "son, he called out to him: ‘My master, who has taken possession of\n",
      "\n",
      "my heart and for whom I yearn, would you enter my shop, mend my\n",
      "\n",
      "broken heart and eat of my food?’ Then, spontaneously, his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000lled with tears and he thought of what he had been and what he\n",
      "\n",
      "now was.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for ‘Ajib, when he heard what his father had said, he felt\n",
      "\n",
      "drawn to him. He told this to the eunuch, adding: ‘It is as though\n",
      "\n",
      "this cook is a man who has parted from his son. Let us go into his\n",
      "\n",
      "shop, so that we may comfort him and eat what he gives us as\n",
      "\n",
      "guests. It may be that, if I do this for him, God may unite me with\n",
      "\n",
      "my father.’ ‘A \u0000ne thing, by God!’ exclaimed the eunuch when he\n",
      "\n",
      "heard this. ‘Do viziers’ sons stay eating in a cookshop? I use this\n",
      "\n",
      "stick to keep people away from you lest they even look at you, and I\n",
      "\n",
      "shall never feel safe in letting you go in here.’ When Hasan heard\n",
      "\n",
      "this, he was astonished and turned to the eunuch with tears running\n",
      "\n",
      "down his cheeks, while ‘Ajib said: ‘My heart is \u0000lled with love for\n",
      "\n",
      "this man.’ ‘Don’t say that,’ the eunuch replied, ‘for you are never\n",
      "\n",
      "going in there.’ Hasan himself then turned to the eunuch and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Great one, why do you not mend my broken heart by entering my\n",
      "\n",
      "shop yourself, you who are like a chestnut, dark but with a white\n",
      "\n",
      "heart, you who \u0000t the description of the poet?’ ‘What is this you\n",
      "\n",
      "say?’ said the eunuch, laughing. ‘Produce the description but keep it\n",
      "\n",
      "short.’ So Hasan started to recite these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Were he not educated and reliable,\n",
      "\n",
      "He would hold no o\u0000ce in the royal palace\n",
      "\n",
      "Or be given charge of the harem. Oh what a servant,\n",
      "\n",
      "Who, for his beauty, heavenly angels serve!\n",
      "\n",
      "The eunuch was \u0000lled with admiration when he heard this and,\n",
      "\n",
      "taking ‘Ajib with him, he entered the shop. Hasan then ladled into a\n",
      "\n",
      "bowl an excellent mixture of pomegranate seeds, almonds and sugar\n",
      "\n",
      "and they both ate after Hasan had welcomed them, saying: ‘You\n",
      "\n",
      "have done me a favour, so enjoy your meal.’ ‘Ajib then said to his\n",
      "\n",
      "father: ‘Sit and eat with us, and it may be that God will bring us\n",
      "\n",
      "together with those whom we wish to meet.’ ‘My boy,’ said Hasan,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘have you, young as you are, had to su\u0000er the loss of dear ones?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, uncle,’ replied ‘Ajib. ‘This has caused me bitter distress, and\n",
      "\n",
      "the one whom I have lost is my father. My grandfather and I have\n",
      "\n",
      "come to search for him through all the lands, and I am \u0000lled with\n",
      "\n",
      "sad longing for him.’ He then wept bitterly and his father wept\n",
      "\n",
      "because of his loss and because of the boy’s tears, remembering the\n",
      "\n",
      "loss of his own loved ones and his separation from his father and his\n",
      "\n",
      "mother, while the eunuch shared his sorrow. They then ate their \u0000ll,\n",
      "\n",
      "after which the two got up, and when they left the shop, Hasan felt\n",
      "\n",
      "as though his soul had parted from his body and gone with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not endure to be parted from them for the blink of an\n",
      "\n",
      "eye and so he locked up his shop and followed, without realizing\n",
      "\n",
      "that ‘Ajib was his son. He hurried on until he caught up with them\n",
      "\n",
      "before they had gone out of the main gate. The eunuch turned and\n",
      "\n",
      "asked what he wanted. ‘When you left my shop,’ replied Hasan, ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "felt that my soul had gone with you and, as I have an errand in the\n",
      "\n",
      "suburbs outside the gate, I wanted to go with you, do my errand,\n",
      "\n",
      "and then go back.’ The eunuch was angry. ‘This is what I was afraid\n",
      "\n",
      "of,’ he told ‘Ajib. ‘The bite that we had to eat was unfortunate in\n",
      "\n",
      "that it has put us under an obligation, and here is that fellow\n",
      "\n",
      "following us from place to place.’ ‘Ajib turned, and \u0000nding Hasan\n",
      "\n",
      "walking behind him, he became angry and his face \u0000ushed red. To\n",
      "\n",
      "the eunuch he said: ‘Let him walk on the public road, but if, when\n",
      "\n",
      "we come out to our tents, we \u0000nd that he is still following us, then\n",
      "\n",
      "we can drive him away.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He then lowered his head and walked on, with the eunuch\n",
      "\n",
      "behind him and Hasan trailing them, as far as the Maidan al-Hasa.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were close to the tents, they turned and saw him still\n",
      "\n",
      "behind them. ‘Ajib was afraid that the eunuch might tell his\n",
      "\n",
      "grandfather, and he became very angry for fear lest he be reported\n",
      "\n",
      "as having entered the cookshop and having been followed by the\n",
      "\n",
      "cook. So he turned and found Hasan’s eyes \u0000xed on his, while Hasan\n",
      "\n",
      "himself looked like a body without a soul. To ‘Ajib it seemed as\n",
      "\n",
      "though his eyes were those of a pervert or that he was a debauchee,\n",
      "\n",
      "and so, in a \u0000t of rage, he took a stone and hit his father with it,\n",
      "\n",
      "knocking him unconscious, with the blood running down over his\n",
      "\n",
      "face. He and the eunuch then went to the tents.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Hasan recovered consciousness, he wiped away the blood,\n",
      "\n",
      "and after cutting o\u0000 a strip of his turban, he bandaged his head. He\n",
      "\n",
      "blamed himself and said: ‘I wronged the boy by shutting up my shop\n",
      "\n",
      "and following him, making him think that I was a pervert.’ So he\n",
      "\n",
      "went back to the shop and went on selling his food, but he started to\n",
      "\n",
      "yearn for his mother in Basra and he recited in tears:\n",
      "\n",
      "You wrong Time if you ask it to be fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not blame it; it was not created for fair dealing.\n",

      "Take what comes easily and leave care aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time must contain both trouble and happiness.\n",

      "after spending three days in Damascus, left for Homs, which he\n",
      "\n",
      "entered, and while he was on his journey he made enquiries\n",
      "\n",
      "wherever he went. He went to Diyar Bakr, Mardin and Mosul, and\n",
      "\n",
      "he kept on travelling until he reached Basra. After entering the city\n",
      "\n",
      "and settling himself there, he went to the sultan. When they met,\n",
      "\n",
      "the sultan treated him with respect and honour and asked him the\n",
      "\n",
      "reason for his visit. Shams al-Din told him his story and that his\n",
      "\n",
      "brother was Nur al-Din ‘Ali. ‘May God have mercy on him,’\n",
      "\n",
      "interjected the sultan, adding: ‘He was my vizier and I loved him\n",

      "dearly, but he died \u0000fteen years ago. He left a son, but the son only\n",
      "\n",
      "stayed for a month after his death before going missing and we have\n",
      "\n",
      "never heard any more news of him, although his mother, the\n",

      "daughter of my old vizier, is still with us.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Shams al-Din heard that the mother of his nephew was\n",
      "\n",
      "well, he was delighted and told the sultan that he would like to\n",
      "\n",
      "meet her. Permission was immediately granted and he went to visit\n",
      "\n",
      "her in his brother’s house. He let his gaze wander around it, and\n",
      "\n",
      "kissing its threshold, he thought of his brother and of how he had\n",
      "\n",
      "died in exile. So he shed tears and recited these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "I pass by the dwellings, the dwellings of Laila,\n",
      "\n",
      "And I kiss \u0000rst one wall and then another.\n",

      "It is not love for the dwellings that wounds my heart,\n",
      "\n",
      "But love for the one who lived in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed through the door into a large hall where there was\n",

      "another door, arched and vaulted with \u0000int inset with marble of\n",
      "\n",
      "di\u0000erent kinds and di\u0000erent colours. He walked through the house,\n",
      "\n",
      "and as he looked at it and glanced around, he found the name of his\n",
      "\n",
      "brother inscribed in letters of gold. He went up to the inscription,\n",
      "\n",
      "kissed it and wept as he remembered his separation from his\n",
      "\n",
      "brother. He then recited these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time it rises, I ask the sun for news of you,\n",
      "\n",
      "And I question the lightning about you when it \u0000ashes.\n",

      "Dear ones, for long, after you went,\n",

      "widow, the mother of Hasan, who throughout her son’s\n",
      "\n",
      "disappearance had been weeping and wailing constantly, night and\n",

      "day. When long years had passed, she had made a marble cenotaph\n",
      "\n",
      "for him in the middle of the hall, where she would shed tears, and it\n",
      "\n",
      "was only beside this that she would sleep. When Shams al-Din came\n",
      "\n",
      "to her room, he heard the sound of her voice, and standing behind\n",
      "\n",
      "the door, he listened to her reciting:\n",
      "\n",
      "In God’s Name, grave, are his beauties now gone,\n",

      "And has that bright face changed?\n",

      "her and told her that he was her husband’s brother, and he then\n",
      "\n",
      "explained what had happened, giving her the full story, that her son\n",

      "and had then disappeared at dawn. ‘He left my daughter pregnant,’\n",
      "\n",
      "Shams al-Din added, ‘and she gave birth to a son who is here with\n",

      "me, and he is your grandson, the son of your son by my daughter.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When she looked at her brother-in-law and heard the news that\n",
      "\n",
      "her son was still alive, she got up and threw herself at his feet,\n",
      "\n",
      "kissing them and reciting:\n",

      "A heart that was torn in pieces when you said goodbye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shams al-Din then sent a message telling ‘Ajib to come, and when\n",
      "\n",
      "he did, his grandmother got up, embraced him and wept. ‘This is no\n",

      "\n",
      "make your preparations to travel with us to Egypt, and perhaps God\n",
      "\n",
      "will allow us and you to join your son, my nephew.’ She agreed to\n",
      "\n",
      "leave and instantly got up to collect what she needed, together with\n",
      "\n",
      "her treasures and her maids. As soon as she was ready, Shams al-Din\n",
      "\n",
      "went to the sultan of Basra and took leave of him, while the sultan,\n",

      "what has happened to that cook whose food we ate and whose head\n",
      "\n",
      "I hurt. He had been kind to me and I harmed him.’ Layiq agreed and\n",

      "\n",
      "After entering the city, they went on until they came to the\n",

      "cookshop, where they found Hasan. It was close to the time of the\n",
      "\n",
      "afternoon prayer and, as luck would have it, he had cooked a dish of\n",
      "\n",
      "pomegranate seeds. When they approached him, ‘Ajib looked at him\n",
      "\n",
      "with a feeling of a\u0000ection, while noting the scar on his forehead left\n",
      "\n",
      "by the blow from the stone. He greeted Hasan a\u0000ectionately, while,\n",
      "\n",
      "for his part, Hasan was agitated: his heart \u0000uttered, he hung his\n",
      "\n",
      "head towards the ground and he tried without success to move his\n",
      "\n",
      "tongue around his mouth. Then looking up at his son, with\n",
      "\n",
      "meekness and humility he recited these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "I wished for my beloved, but when he came in sight,\n",
      "\n",
      "In my bewilderment I could not control tongue or eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bowed my head in reverence and respect;\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to hide my feelings, but in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had whole reams of blame to give to him,\n",
      "\n",
      "But when we met I could not speak a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he said to ‘Ajib: ‘Mend my broken heart and eat of my food.\n",
      "\n",
      "By God, when I look at you, my heart races and it was only because\n",
      "\n",
      "I had lost my wits that I followed you.’ ‘You must indeed be fond of\n",
      "\n",
      "me. I took a bite to eat with you, after which you followed me,\n",
      "\n",
      "wanting to bring shame on me. I shall only eat your food on\n",
      "\n",
      "condition that you swear not to come out after me or follow me\n",
      "\n",
      "again, for otherwise I shall never come back here, although we are\n",
      "\n",
      "staying for a week so that my grandfather can buy gifts for the\n",

      "sultan.’ Hasan agreed and ‘Ajib entered with his servant. Hasan\n",
      "\n",
      "presented them with a bowl of pomegranate seeds and ‘Ajib asked\n",
      "\n",
      "him to give them the pleasure of eating with him. He accepted\n",
      "\n",
      "gladly, but as his heart and body were concentrated on ‘Ajib, he\n",
      "\n",
      "kept staring \u0000xedly at his face. ‘Ajib objected, saying: ‘Didn’t I tell\n",
      "\n",
      "you that you are an unwelcome lover, so stop staring at my face.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Hasan heard what his son said, he recited these lines:\n",

      "You have a hidden secret in men’s hearts,\n",
      "\n",
      "Folded away, concealed and not spread out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your beauty puts to shame the gleaming moon\n",

      "Hasan kept \u0000lling ‘Ajib’s plate and then that of the eunuch. They\n",

      "ate their \u0000ll and then got up. Hasan rose himself and poured water\n",
      "\n",
      "over their hands, after which he unfastened a silk towel from his\n",

      "waist on which he dried their hands before sprinkling them with\n",

      "rosewater from a \u0000ask that he had with him. Then he left his shop\n",

      "full, as they had had more than usual.\n",

      "for ‘Ajib, when he took his seat, his stomach was full of what he had\n",
      "\n",
      "already eaten and drunk, but he took a morsel, dipped it among the\n",
      "\n",
      "pomegranate seeds and ate it. Because he was full, he found it\n",

      "‘We didn’t go into the shop but merely passed by it.’ ‘Ajib, however,\n",
      "\n",
      "insisted that they had gone in and had eaten, adding: ‘And it was\n",

      "brought before him. ‘Why did you take my grandson into the\n",

      "this, but ‘Ajib insisted: ‘We did go in and we ate pomegranate seeds\n",
      "\n",
      "until we were full, after which the cook gave us a drink with snow\n",
      "\n",
      "and sugar.’ Shams al-Din became even angrier with the eunuch and\n",
      "\n",
      "asked him again. He again denied it, at which Shams al-Din said: ‘If\n",
      "\n",
      "you are telling me the truth, then sit down and eat in front of me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The eunuch came forward and tried to do this but failed and had to\n",

      "full from yesterday.’ Shams al-Din then realized that he had indeed\n",
      "\n",
      "eaten in the cookshop. He ordered the slaves to throw him down,\n",
      "\n",
      "which they did, and he then started to beat him painfully. The\n",
      "\n",
      "eunuch called for help. ‘Don’t beat me, master,’ he cried, ‘and I’ll tell\n",
      "\n",
      "you the truth.’ After this, Shams al-Din stopped beating him and\n",
      "\n",
      "demanded the truth. ‘We did go into the shop,’ he said, ‘and the\n",

      "\n",
      "which is better and more tasty.’ The eunuch agreed and was given a\n",

      "\n",
      "nobody can cook properly except for my mother and me, and she is\n",
      "\n",
      "now in a distant land.’ He then ladled the food into the bowl and\n",

      "\n",
      "The eunuch carried it back quickly to the camp, where Hasan’s\n",

      "\n",
      "was and how well it had been cooked, she realized who must have\n",
      "\n",
      "cooked it and gave a shriek before falling in a faint, to the\n",
      "\n",

      "after a time she recovered. ‘If my son is still in this world,’ she\n",

      "you are looking for?’ ‘He is a cook,’ replied Shams al-Din, and the\n",
      "\n",
      "governor instantly ordered his chamberlains to go to his shop. They\n",
      "\n",
      "went and found the shop demolished with all its contents smashed,\n",
      "\n",
      "for when Shams al-Din had gone to the governor’s palace, his men\n",

      "wrong?’ ‘Yes, immediately,’ said Shams al-Din, but he then called to\n",
      "\n",
      "the servants to bring the camels. They took Hasan with them, put\n",

      "him in a box, locked it and set o\u0000, travelling until nightfall. Then\n",

      "they halted and ate some food. They took Hasan out of his box, gave\n",
      "\n",
      "him something to eat and then put him back in it. They followed\n",
      "\n",
      "this pattern until they reached Qamra, when Hasan was taken out of\n",
      "\n",
      "his box and was again asked whether it was he who had cooked the\n",
      "\n",
      "pomegranate seeds. When he still said yes, Shams al-Din ordered\n",
      "\n",
      "him to be fettered, which was done and he was put back in the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party then travelled on to Cairo, where they halted at the\n",
      "\n",
      "Raidaniya camping ground. Shams al-Din ordered Hasan to be taken\n",
      "\n",
      "out and he ordered a carpenter to be fetched whom he told to make\n",
      "\n",
      "a wooden cross. ‘What are you going to do with it?’ asked Hasan. ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "will garrotte you on it and then nail you to it, before parading you\n",
      "\n",
      "around the whole city,’ Shams al-Din told him. ‘Why are you doing\n",
      "\n",
      "this to me?’ asked Hasan. ‘Because of your ill-omened cooking of the\n",
      "\n",
      "pomegranate seeds, for you cooked them without enough pepper,’\n",
      "\n",
      "replied Shams al-Din. ‘Are you really doing all this to me because\n",
      "\n",
      "the dish lacked pepper?’ said Hasan. ‘Was it not enough for you to\n",
      "\n",
      "keep me shut up, giving me only one meal a day?’ ‘There was not\n",
      "\n",
      "enough pepper,’ said Shams al-Din, ‘and the only punishment for\n",

      "intelligence you would not treat me like this.’ ‘We have to punish\n",
      "\n",
      "you,’ said Shams al-Din, ‘so as to see that you don’t do this kind of\n",

      "thing again.’ ‘The least part of what you have done to me is a\n",
      "\n",

      "strangled.\n",
      "\n",
      "While all this was going on, the carpenter was preparing the\n",

      "Din took Hasan and threw him into the box, saying: ‘The execution\n",

      "will take place tomorrow.’ He then waited until he was sure that\n",

      "Hasan was asleep, when he got up, lifted the chest and, after\n",
      "\n",
      "mounting his horse, he placed the box in front of him. He entered\n",
      "\n",
      "the city and rode on until he came to his house. To his daughter, Sitt\n",
      "\n",
      "al-Husn, he said: ‘Praise be to God who has reunited you with your\n",
      "\n",
      "cousin. Get up and arrange the furnishings of the house as they were\n",
      "\n",
      "on your wedding night.’ The household was roused and the candles\n",
      "\n",
      "were lit, while Shams al-Din produced the paper on which he had\n",
      "\n",
      "drawn a plan showing how the furniture was to be arranged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was put in its place, so that anyone looking at it would\n",
      "\n",
      "be in no doubt that this was as it had been on the actual wedding\n",
      "\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shams al-Din gave instructions that Hasan’s turban should be\n",
      "\n",
      "placed where he himself had left it, as should his trousers and the\n",
      "\n",
      "purse that was beneath the mattress. He then told his daughter to\n",
      "\n",
      "wear no more than she had been wearing when left alone with her\n",
      "\n",
      "bridegroom on her wedding night. ‘When your cousin comes in,’ he\n",
      "\n",
      "said, ‘tell him that he has been a long time in his visit to the latrine\n",
      "\n",
      "and then invite him to pass the rest of the night with you. Talk with\n",
      "\n",
      "him until daybreak, and I shall then explain the whole a\u0000air to him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, he took Hasan out of the chest, having \u0000rst removed the\n",
      "\n",
      "fetters from his feet. He stripped o\u0000 the clothes that he was wearing,\n",
      "\n",
      "so that he was left in a thin nightshirt with no trousers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sleeping Hasan knew nothing about what was happening,\n",
      "\n",
      "but, as fate had decreed, he turned over and woke up to \u0000nd himself\n",
      "\n",
      "in a brilliantly lit hallway. ‘This is a confused dream,’ he said to\n",
      "\n",
      "himself, but he then walked a short way to a second door, and, on\n",
      "\n",
      "looking, he found himself in the room in which his bride had been\n",
      "\n",
      "unveiled for him. There was the alcove and the chair and he could\n",
      "\n",
      "see his turban and his other things. He was astonished at this sight\n",
      "\n",
      "and hesitated, moving forwards and then backwards. ‘Am I asleep or\n",
      "\n",
      "awake?’ he asked himself, wiping his forehead and saying in\n",
      "\n",
      "amazement: ‘By God, this is the room of the bride who was unveiled\n",
      "\n",
      "for me; but where am I, for I was in a box?’\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was talking to himself, Sitt al-Husn suddenly lifted the\n",
      "\n",
      "bottom of the alcove curtain and said: ‘Master, are you not going to\n",
      "\n",
      "come in? You have been a long time in the latrine.’ When he heard\n",
      "\n",
      "her voice and looked at her face, he laughed and said: ‘I am in a\n",
      "\n",
      "confused dream.’ He went into the alcove, where he sighed, and,\n",
      "\n",
      "thinking over his experiences, he was \u0000lled with confusion,\n",
      "\n",
      "particularly at the sight of the turban, his trousers and the purse\n",
      "\n",
      "with the thousand dinars, and was at a loss to grasp what had\n",
      "\n",
      "happened. ‘God knows better,’ he said, ‘but this is a muddled\n",
      "\n",
      "dream.’ ‘What are you so astonished about?’ asked Sitt al-Husn. ‘You\n",
      "\n",
      "weren’t like that at the beginning of the night.’ Hasan laughed and\n",
      "\n",
      "asked: ‘How long have I been away from you?’ ‘Bless you,’ she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘and may the Name of God encompass you, you left to attend to\n",
      "\n",
      "yourself and then come back. Are you out of your mind?’ Hasan\n",
      "\n",
      "laughed when he heard that and said: ‘You are right, but when I left\n",
      "\n",
      "you I took leave of my senses in the latrine and dreamt that I was a\n",
      "\n",
      "cook in Damascus and had been there for ten years, when a boy, a\n",
      "\n",
      "great man’s son, came in with a eunuch.’\n",
      "\n",
      "At that, he rubbed his hand over his forehead and found the scar\n",
      "\n",
      "on it. ‘By God, lady,’ he said, ‘that almost seems to be true, because\n",
      "\n",
      "he struck me on the forehead and broke the skin, and it seemed as\n",
      "\n",
      "though I was awake at the time.’ He went on: ‘It was as though we\n",
      "\n",
      "had just gone to sleep in each other’s arms and then I had this\n",
      "\n",
      "dream and I appeared to have arrived in Damascus with no turban\n",
      "\n",
      "and no trousers and then worked as a cook.’ After remaining\n",
      "\n",
      "perplexed for a time, he said: ‘By God, I seemed to see that I had\n",
      "\n",
      "cooked a dish of pomegranate seeds and had put on too little\n",
      "\n",
      "pepper, but I suppose that I must have been asleep in the latrine and\n",
      "\n",
      "I must have seen all this in a dream.’ ‘What else did you see?’ asked\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitt al-Husn. Hasan told her, and then he said: ‘By God, if I had not\n",
      "\n",
      "woken up, they would have cruci\u0000ed me.’ ‘What for?’ she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Because there was too little pepper on the pomegranate seeds,’ he\n",
      "\n",
      "replied. ‘It seemed as though they had wrecked my shop and broken\n",
      "\n",
      "up my utensils and put me in a box. Then they brought a carpenter\n",

      "to make a cross for me and they were going to garrotte me. Thank\n",
      "\n",
      "God that all this happened in a dream and not in real life.’ Sitt al-\n",
      "\n",
      "Husn laughed and clasped him to her breast as he clasped her to his,\n",

      "what he was doing and distracting him from his prayer. When that\n",

      "had gone on for a long time, one day he took o\u0000 his shirt and put it\n",

      "\n",
      "and her love had so strong a grip on me that all my wealth was as\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing beside it. We then started to play, dallying with each other\n",
      "\n",
      "and exchanging kisses until nightfall. At this point, the maids\n",
      "\n",
      "produced us a complete meal with food and wine, and we drank\n",

      "until midnight, when we went to bed. I slept with her until morning,\n",
      "\n",
      "and never in my life have I experienced a night like that. In the\n",

      "went to the bedroom and slept until morning. Then I got up, gave\n",

      "her the \u0000fty dinars as before and left. The donkey man was there\n",

      "\n",
      "of people blocking the gate. As was fated, I saw a soldier and jostled\n",

      "him unintentionally. I touched his pocket with my hand, and on\n",

      "\n",
      "asked whether there had been anyone with him. ‘No,’ he said, and\n",
      "\n",
      "the wali shouted to his police chief, who laid hold of me, leaving me\n",
      "\n",
      "no place to hide. ‘Strip him,’ ordered the wali, and when they did,\n",

      "the soldier had said. He shouted angrily to the guards, who brought\n",

      "this purse?’ I hung my head and said to myself: ‘I can say that I\n",

      "didn’t steal it, but it has been found on me, and yet, if I confess that\n",
      "\n",
      "I did steal it, then I am in trouble.’ So I raised my head and said:\n",

      "this was happening by the Zuwaila gate. The wali then gave orders\n",

      "to the executioner, who cut o\u0000 my right hand. Afterwards the\n",

      "me and went on his way. The people stayed around me and gave me\n",

      "a glass of wine, while the soldier gave me his purse, saying: ‘You are\n",
      "\n",
      "a handsome young man and you should not be a thief.’ I recited the\n",

      "By God, I am no robber, my trusty friend,\n",

      "my altered colour and asked: ‘What is paining you? Why do I see\n",

      "that your manner has changed?’ ‘I have a headache,’ I replied, ‘and\n",

      "‘I don’t want to eat just now,’ I told her, but she persisted: ‘Tell me\n",

      "broken-hearted.’ ‘I shall tell you soon in my own time,’ I said. Then\n",

      "\n",
      "looked and saw an arm without a hand; on searching me, she found\n",

      "\n",
      "and then laid down the purse and was about to go out, when she\n",

      "and lost your hand? I take you as my witness – and God is the truest\n",
      "\n",
      "witness – that I shall never leave you, and you shall see that what I\n",
      "\n",
      "say is true.’ Then she sent for the notaries, and when they came she\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘Draw up a marriage contract for me and this young man and\n",
      "\n",
      "bear witness that I have already received my dowry.’ They did as\n",
      "\n",
      "they were told, and then she said: ‘Bear witness that all my wealth,\n",
      "\n",
      "which is in this chest, and that all my slaves and servant girls are his\n",

      "property.’ This they did, and I accepted the transfer of ownership,\n",
      "\n",
      "after which they took their fee and left.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then took me by the hand and led me to a closet, where she\n",

      "in her chest to mine and added my money to what I had given her. I\n",

      "\n",
      "distressed by my own distress, until I told her all that had happened\n",

      "very sick, and her illness intensi\u0000ed, until after only \u0000fty days she\n",

      "\n",
      "and distributed money and alms in her name, after which I went\n",

      "away from her tomb. I then found out that she had left a huge store\n",

      "of money, together with properties and estates, and among the\n",

      "storehouses was one \u0000lled with sesame, some of which I sold to you.\n",

      "country? I have bought trade goods from Cairo and Alexandria, so\n",
      "\n",
      "will you come?’ I agreed to this and arranged to meet him on the\n",

      "forward and said: ‘With your permission, I will tell you a story of\n",

      "what happened to me just before I found this hunchback. If it is\n",
      "\n",
      "more remarkable than the previous tale, will you spare all our\n",

      "\n",
      "You must know, your majesty, that last night I was with a group\n",
      "\n",
      "who had organized a recitation of the Quran, for which the faqihs\n",
      "\n",
      "had been brought together. When the reciters had performed their\n",

      "task and \u0000nished, a table was set out and among the foods that were\n",
      "\n",
      "produced was a dish made with sugar, almonds and vinegar. We\n",
      "\n",
      "came forward to eat, but one of our number held back and refused\n",
      "\n",
      "to join in. We urged him, but he swore that he would not eat any of\n",
      "\n",
      "it, and when we pressed him, he said: ‘Don’t force me. What\n",
      "\n",
      "happened to me the last time I ate this is enough for me,’ and he\n",

      "had refused the dish. ‘If I have to eat it,’ he said, ‘I can only do that\n",
      "\n",
      "after I have washed my hands forty times with soap, forty times\n",
      "\n",
      "with potash and forty times with galingale; that is, a total of a\n",

      "servants, who brought water and the other things for which he had\n",
      "\n",
      "asked, after which he washed his hands as I have described. He then\n",

      "\u0000lling us with surprise. His hand was shaking and when he raised it\n",
      "\n",
      "up, we could see that the thumb was missing and that he was eating\n",
      "\n",
      "with four \u0000ngers. We asked what had happened to his thumb,\n",
      "\n",
      "whether he had been born like that or whether he had su\u0000ered an\n",
      "\n",
      "accident. ‘Brothers,’ he replied, ‘it is not only this thumb, but the\n",
      "\n",
      "other one as well, together with both my big toes. Wait till you see.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He then uncovered his left hand, and we found that it was like the\n",

      "washed his hands a hundred and twenty times. HE BEGAN:\n",

      "Know that my father was one of the leading merchants of\n",

      "\n",
      "fond of drinking wine and listening to the lute and other musical\n",

      "instruments. As a result, on his death he had nothing to leave. I\n",

      "\n",
      "After a period of mourning, I opened up his shop, but I found that\n",
      "\n",
      "there was very little there and that he was in debt. I placated his\n",
      "\n",
      "creditors and persuaded them to wait, after which I started to trade,\n",

      "making them a weekly payment. Things went on like this for a time\n",

      "until I had paid o\u0000 the debts and had added to my capital.\n",

      "Then one day as I was sitting there, before I knew what was\n",

      "riding on a mule, with one slave in front of her and another behind.\n",

      "know, lest we \u0000nd ourselves in the \u0000re.’ He stood guarding her from\n",

      "sight as she looked at the merchants’ shops, of which, as she found,\n",
      "\n",
      "mine was the only one open. She walked in, with the eunuch behind\n",

      "her, and sat down. The girl greeted me in the loveliest and sweetest\n",
      "\n",
      "voice that I had ever heard, and when she uncovered her face, I saw\n",
      "\n",
      "that she was as radiant as the moon. The glance that I threw her was\n",
      "\n",
      "followed by a thousand sighs, and love for her became \u0000xed in my\n",

      "heart. Looking again and again at her face, I recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Say to the lovely girl in the veil of the ringdove’s colouring:\n",

      "‘It is certain that only death will relieve me from the torture\n",

      "Here is my hand stretched to you, hoping for bounty.’\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing this, she replied:\n",

      "Whereas my heart loves none but you.\n",

      "drowning in the sea of love and lost in my passion for her, until the\n",

      "all that she wanted, at a price of \u0000ve thousand dirhams, after which\n",
      "\n",

      "that I was too bashful to ask. The merchants made me guarantee the\n",
      "\n",
      "purchase price, and so I shouldered the debt of \u0000ve thousand\n",
      "\n",
      "dirhams, and went back home, drunk with love. My servants\n",
      "\n",
      "brought me my evening meal but I only ate a mouthful, thinking of\n",
      "\n",
      "the girl’s beauty and grace. I tried to sleep but no sleep would come,\n",
      "\n",
      "and I stayed in this restless state for a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point, the merchants asked me for their money, but I\n",
      "\n",
      "persuaded them to wait for another week. At the end of this, the girl\n",
      "\n",
      "appeared, riding on her mule, accompanied by a eunuch and two\n",
      "\n",
      "slaves. She greeted me and said: ‘Sir, I have been slow in paying you\n",
      "\n",
      "for the materials. Bring the money-changer and take the cash.’ The\n",
      "\n",
      "money-changer duly came and the eunuch produced the money,\n",
      "\n",
      "which then I took. The girl and I talked together until the market\n",
      "\n",
      "opened, when she told me to get her other materials. I fetched these\n",
      "\n",
      "for her from the merchants, and she then went o\u0000 without having\n",
      "\n",
      "said anything to me about the price. This was something I regretted\n",
      "\n",
      "after she had gone, since it had cost me a thousand dinars to get\n",
      "\n",
      "what she wanted, and as soon as she was out of sight, I asked\n",
      "\n",
      "myself: ‘What is this love? She gave me \u0000ve thousand dirhams but I\n",
      "\n",
      "have just spent a thousand dinars.’ I was sure that I would \u0000nd\n",
      "\n",
      "myself reduced to poverty thanks to what I owed the merchants. ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "am the only one whom they know,’ I said to myself, ‘and this\n",
      "\n",
      "woman is nothing but a swindler who has used her beauty and grace\n",
      "\n",
      "to fool me. She thought of me as a little boy and laughed at me and\n",
      "\n",
      "I never even asked her where she lived.’\n",
      "\n",
      "These misgivings stayed with me, and for more than a month she\n",
      "\n",
      "did not return. The merchants came to press me for their money and\n",
      "\n",
      "they forced me to sell my property, leaving me facing ruin. I was\n",
      "\n",
      "sitting, lost in thought, when before I knew it, there she was,\n",
      "\n",
      "dismounting at the gate of the market. She came into my shop and,\n",
      "\n",
      "when I saw her, my cares left me and I forgot my troubles. She came\n",
      "\n",
      "up and talked to me sweetly and then said: ‘Fetch the money-\n",
      "\n",
      "changer and have your money weighed out,’ after which she gave\n",
      "\n",
      "me the price of the goods that she had taken and added in a pro\u0000t.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she talked with me in so relaxed a way that I almost died of\n",
      "\n",
      "joy and delight. ‘Have you a wife?’ she asked. ‘No,’ I told her, ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "know no women at all,’ and I burst into tears. ‘Why are you crying?’\n",
      "\n",
      "she asked, and I replied: ‘It’s all right.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I then took some of the dinars and gave them to the eunuch,\n",

      "asking him to act as my go-between in the a\u0000air, but he laughed at\n",
      "\n",
      "me and said: ‘She loves you more than you love her. She didn’t need\n",
      "\n",
      "the stu\u0000 that she bought from you and she bought it only because of\n",
      "\n",
      "her love for you. Ask her whatever you want; she will not say no to\n",
      "\n",
      "you.’ The lady saw me giving money to him, and she came back and\n",
      "\n",
      "sat down. Then I said to her: ‘Be generous to your servant and give\n",
      "\n",
      "him what he asks.’ I told her what was in my heart and she agreed\n",
      "\n",
      "to my request. ‘Do you bring my messages,’ she told the eunuch, and\n",
      "\n",
      "to me she said: ‘Do what the eunuch tells you.’ She got up and left,\n",
      "\n",
      "while I went and handed over their money to the merchants, being\n",
      "\n",
      "left with a pro\u0000t.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then received no further news of her, and such was my regret I\n",
      "\n",
      "could not sleep at night, but after a few days the eunuch came back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I welcomed him with respect and asked him about his mistress. ‘She\n",
      "\n",
      "is ill,’ he said, and I asked him to explain her position to me. ‘This\n",
      "\n",
      "girl,’ he told me, ‘was brought up by the Lady Zubaida, the wife of\n",
      "\n",
      "the caliph Harun al-Rashid, and she is one of her maidservants. She\n",
      "\n",
      "asked to be allowed to come and go as she pleased, and she has\n",
      "\n",
      "reached a position of authority. She talked about you to her mistress\n",
      "\n",
      "and asked whether she would marry her to you. “No, I shall not,”\n",
      "\n",
      "replied Lady Zubaida, “until I see the young man, and then, if he is\n",
      "\n",
      "a suitable match for you, I shall give consent.” We need to smuggle\n",
      "\n",
      "you into the palace now; if you succeed, you will be able to marry\n",
      "\n",
      "the girl, but if you are found out, your head will be cut o\u0000. What do\n",
      "\n",
      "you say?’ ‘I will go with you,’ I said, ‘and endure the fate you have\n",
      "\n",
      "described.’ The eunuch said: ‘Go tonight to the mosque, pray and\n",
      "\n",
      "spend the night there – that is the mosque which the Lady Zubaida\n",
      "\n",
      "built by the Tigris.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I willingly agreed and in the evening I went to the mosque,\n",
      "\n",
      "performed my prayers and spent the night there. At daybreak,\n",
      "\n",
      "eunuchs arrived in a little boat, bringing with them several empty\n",
      "\n",
      "chests, which they brought to the mosque, before going o\u0000 again.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of them stayed behind and, when I looked at him, I recognized\n",
      "\n",
      "him as my go-between. A little later, the girl arrived. When she\n",
      "\n",
      "came forward, I got up and embraced her; she kissed me and burst\n",
      "\n",
      "into tears, after which we talked for some time. Then she took me\n",
      "\n",
      "and put me in a chest, which she locked. She approached the\n",
      "\n",
      "eunuch, who had with him a large quantity of goods, and these she\n",
      "\n",
      "started to take and pack in the other chests, locking them one after\n",
      "\n",
      "the other until she had packed them all. The servants then loaded\n",
      "\n",
      "them on the boat and set o\u0000 for Lady Zubaida’s palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "I became anxious, saying to myself that my lust would lead to my\n",
      "\n",
      "death, and wondering whether I would or would not succeed. I\n",
      "\n",
      "started to weep inside the chest and prayed God to deliver me from\n",
      "\n",
      "my plight. The servants continued their journey until they had\n",
      "\n",
      "brought all the chests to the gate of the caliph’s palace, carrying in\n",
      "\n",
      "mine together with the others. They passed by a number of eunuchs\n",
      "\n",
      "entrusted with the protection of the harem, together with some of\n",
      "\n",
      "the harem women, until they came to a senior eunuch. Roused from\n",
      "\n",
      "his sleep, he shouted to the girl: ‘What is in these chests?’ ‘They are\n",
      "\n",
      "full of goods for Lady Zubaida,’ she said. ‘Open them up one by\n",
      "\n",
      "one,’ he ordered, ‘so that I can look at the contents.’ ‘Why do you\n",
      "\n",
      "want them opened?’ she objected, but he shouted at her: ‘Don’t\n",
      "\n",
      "waste time; these chests must be opened!’\n",
      "\n",
      "He got to his feet and the \u0000rst chest that he wanted to be opened\n",
      "\n",
      "was the one in which I was hidden. When it was brought to him, I\n",
      "\n",
      "lost my senses; I was so afraid that I was unable to control myself\n",
      "\n",
      "and my urine seeped from the chest. The girl cried to the eunuch:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You have destroyed me and destroyed yourself, as you have spoiled\n",
      "\n",
      "something worth ten thousand dinars. In this chest are coloured\n",
      "\n",
      "dresses and four manns’ of Zamzam water. The container has just\n",
      "\n",
      "fallen open and the water has leaked out over the clothes in the\n",
      "\n",
      "chest, ruining their colours.’ ‘Take your chests and go, God damn\n",
      "\n",
      "you,’ said the eunuch. So the servants hurriedly carried o\u0000 the chest\n",
      "\n",
      "that I was in, bringing the others with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were on their way, I heard someone saying: ‘Woe,\n",
      "\n",
      "woe, the caliph, the caliph!’ When I heard that, I almost died of\n",
      "\n",
      "fright, exclaiming: ‘There is no might and no power except with\n",
      "\n",
      "God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent’ – words which never bring shame\n",
      "\n",
      "on those who repeat them. To which I added: ‘This is a disaster that\n",
      "\n",
      "I have brought on myself.’ I then heard the caliph asking my\n",
      "\n",
      "mistress what was in the chests. ‘Clothes belonging to the Lady\n",
      "\n",
      "Zubaida,’ she said. ‘Open them for me,’ he ordered, and when I\n",
      "\n",
      "heard that, I felt that I had truly died, saying to myself: ‘By God, this\n",
      "\n",
      "is the last day of my life in this world. If I escape, I shall marry her –\n",
      "\n",
      "no question about it – but if I am found out, then my head will be\n",
      "\n",
      "cut o\u0000.’ I started to recite: ‘I bear witness that there is no god but\n",
      "\n",
      "God and Muhammad is the Apostle of God.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",
      "\n",
      "been allowed to say. Then, when it was the twenty-eighth night, SHE\n",
      "\n",
      "CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that the young man recited the\n",
      "\n",
      "confession of faith. HE WENT ON:\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard the girl say: ‘The contents of these chests has been left in\n",
      "\n",
      "my charge. There are some dresses for the Lady Zubaida and she\n",
      "\n",
      "wants no one to look at them.’ ‘The chests must be opened,’ said the\n",
      "\n",
      "caliph, ‘and I shall inspect what is in them.’ Then he shouted to the\n",
      "\n",
      "eunuchs: ‘Bring them to me,’ at which I was so certain that I was\n",
      "\n",
      "going to die that I lost consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the eunuchs began to bring forward the chests one\n",
      "\n",
      "by one, and the caliph looked at their contents: rare perfumes,\n",
      "\n",
      "costly materials and splendid dresses. They carried on opening the\n",
      "\n",
      "chests as the caliph inspected the dresses and whatever else was in\n",
      "\n",
      "them, until the only one left was the chest which contained me. The\n",
      "\n",
      "eunuchs had reached out to open it when the girl rushed up to the\n",
      "\n",
      "caliph and said: ‘This chest in front of you is only to be opened in\n",
      "\n",
      "the presence of Lady Zubaida, for it is the one that contains her\n",
      "\n",
      "secret.’ When the caliph heard this, he ordered that they should all\n",
      "\n",
      "be taken into her quarters. The eunuchs came and carried me in my\n",
      "\n",
      "chest before setting it down in the middle of the hall among the\n",
      "\n",
      "other ones. My mouth was dry, but the girl let me out and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All’s well; don’t be afraid. You can relax happily. Sit down until the\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Zubaida comes, and it may be your good fortune to win me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat there for a time, until suddenly ten maidens like moons\n",
      "\n",
      "came forward, and formed two lines of \u0000ve, facing each other. They\n",
      "\n",
      "were followed by twenty more swelling-breasted virgins and in the\n",
      "\n",
      "middle of them was Lady Zubaida, wearing such a quantity of\n",
      "\n",
      "jewellery and such splendid robes that she could scarcely walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she came forward, the maids round about her dispersed and I\n",
      "\n",
      "went up and kissed the ground before her. She gestured to me to sit,\n",
      "\n",
      "and when I had taken my place in front of her, she began to\n",
      "\n",
      "question me. She asked about my family background and she was\n",
      "\n",
      "pleased at my answers to all her questions. She said to the girl: ‘The\n",
      "\n",
      "way that I brought you up has not proved a failure,’ and to me she\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘Know that this girl is like a daughter to me and she is\n",
      "\n",
      "entrusted by God to your protection.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I kissed the ground before her, happy that I was to be allowed to\n",
      "\n",
      "marry. On Lady Zubaida’s orders, I stayed in the palace for ten days,\n",
      "\n",
      "during which I did not see the girl but was brought my meals\n",
      "\n",
      "morning and evening by a servant. At the end of this period, the\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Zubaida consulted the caliph about the girl’s marriage, and he\n",
      "\n",
      "gave his permission, as well as providing the girl with ten thousand\n",
      "\n",
      "dinars. Lady Zubaida sent for the notaries and the qadi and they\n",
      "\n",
      "drew up her marriage contract. After that the servants prepared\n",
      "\n",
      "sweetmeats and splendid dishes, which they distributed among all\n",
      "\n",
      "the rooms in the harem. Ten more days passed like this and after a\n",
      "\n",
      "total of twenty days, the girl went to the baths.\n",
      "\n",
      "The servants then brought a small table, on which among other\n",
      "\n",
      "dishes was a plate of sugared almonds and vinegar, on top of which\n",
      "\n",
      "had been poured rosewater scented with musk. It contained roasted\n",
      "\n",
      "chicken breasts and an astonishing variety of other ingredients. I\n",
      "\n",
      "didn’t wait but set upon it and ate my \u0000ll, but although I wiped my\n",
      "\n",
      "hands, I forgot to wash them. I sat there until nightfall, when the\n",
      "\n",
      "candles were lit and the singing girls came in with their\n",
      "\n",
      "tambourines. They went round the whole palace, displaying the\n",
      "\n",
      "bride and being showered with gold coins, after which they brought\n",
      "\n",
      "her forward, having taken o\u0000 her outer clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found myself alone with her on the bed, and I embraced her,\n",
      "\n",
      "scarcely believing that I was going to enjoy union with her. Then,\n",
      "\n",
      "on my hand, she caught the scent of the dish I had eaten and she\n",
      "\n",
      "screamed aloud. The maids came in from all sides, while I trembled,\n",
      "\n",
      "not knowing what was happening. ‘What is the matter with you,\n",
      "\n",
      "sister?’ they asked. ‘Remove this madman from me,’ she said, ‘for I\n",
      "\n",
      "had thought that he was a person of sense.’ ‘What symptom of\n",
      "\n",
      "madness have you seen in me?’ I asked her. ‘Madman,’ she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘how is it that you ate the almond dish without washing your\n",
      "\n",
      "hands? By God, I shall repay you for what you have done. Is\n",
      "\n",
      "someone like you to sleep with someone like me?’ Then from beside\n",
      "\n",
      "her she took a plaited whip and started to beat my back and then\n",
      "\n",
      "my buttocks with so many strokes that I fainted. ‘Take him,’ she\n",
      "\n",
      "ordered the maids, ‘and bring him to the city magistrate to cut o\u0000\n",
      "\n",
      "the hand with which he ate the almond dish and which he failed to\n",
      "\n",
      "wash.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard this, I exclaimed: ‘There is no might and no power\n",

      "except with God! Is my hand to be cut o\u0000 simply because I ate that\n",
      "\n",
      "dish and didn’t then wash my hands?’ The maids interceded with\n",
      "\n",
      "her and said: ‘Sister, don’t punish him this time for this fault.’ ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "must cut o\u0000 some of his extremities,’ she said, after which she went\n",
      "\n",
      "away. She stayed away for ten days, during which I didn’t see her,\n",
      "\n",
      "but after that she came back to me and said: ‘Black face, I’ll teach\n",
      "\n",
      "you how to eat without washing your hands!’ Then she called to the\n",
      "\n",
      "maids, who tied me up, and taking a sharp razor she cut o\u0000 my\n",
      "\n",
      "thumbs and my big toes, as you all can see. I fainted, but she\n",
      "\n",
      "sprinkled powder over me, which stopped the \u0000ow of blood. I\n",
      "\n",
      "started to say that I would never again eat that dish without \u0000rst\n",
      "\n",
      "washing my hands forty times with potash, forty times with\n",
      "\n",
      "galingale and forty times with soap. She made me swear to do this,\n",
      "\n",
      "as I have said, and that is why, when you produced this dish, I\n",
      "\n",
      "changed colour and said to myself that this was why I had lost my\n",
      "\n",
      "thumbs and my big toes, and when you forced it on me, I said that I\n",
      "\n",
      "must keep the oath that I had sworn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man was then asked what had happened after that. ‘When I\n",
      "\n",
      "swore that oath for her,’ he said, ‘she calmed down and she and I\n",
      "\n",
      "slept together. We stayed there for a time, but after that she said\n",
      "\n",
      "that the caliph’s palace was not a good place for us to be. “No man\n",
      "\n",
      "apart from you has ever entered it and you only did that because of\n",
      "\n",
      "the care taken by the Lady Zubaida. She has given me \u0000fty thousand\n",

      "dinars, so take the money and go out to buy us a house.” I went and\n",
      "\n",
      "bought one that was both handsome and spacious, and into this she\n",

      "\n",
      "me a face like the moon at its full. I had never seen anyone more\n",
      "\n",
      "beautiful. I then rose and brought food and wine, after which we ate\n",

      "prettier than she was. ‘Yes, by God,’ I replied. ‘I would like you to\n",
      "\n",
      "sleep with her,’ she told me and when I agreed she got up and\n",
      "\n",
      "spread out bedding for us. I went over to the girl and slept with her\n",
      "\n",
      "until morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I stirred, I found that I was very damp and I thought that I\n",

      "must have been sweating. I sat up to rouse the girl and shook her by\n",

      "the shoulders, at which her head rolled o\u0000 the pillow. Losing\n",

      "\n",
      "her throat had been cut and I sprang up, \u0000nding that the world had\n",
      "\n",
      "turned black for me. I looked for my former mistress but when I\n",

      "except with God, the High, the Almighty!’ I exclaimed. ‘What am I\n",
      "\n",
      "to do?’ I thought for a time and then I got up and stripped o\u0000 my\n",
      "\n",
      "clothes. In the middle of the house I dug a hole and then I took the\n",
      "\n",
      "girl, jewels and all, and put her into it, after which I covered it with\n",
      "\n",
      "earth and then with marble. Next, I washed, put on clean clothes\n",
      "\n",
      "and, taking what money I still had, I left the house, locked it up, and\n",
      "\n",
      "went to its owner. Summoning up my courage, I paid him a year’s\n",

      "\n",
      "asked me why I had come, I told them that it was because I had\n",
      "\n",
      "missed them. I stayed with them for a year, seeing the sights of\n",
      "\n",
      "Cairo and the Nile, but concealing the fact that I still had some\n",

      "money with me. Then, taking my store of money, I started to spend\n",

      "it, using it on food and drink, until the time had come for my uncles\n",

      "to leave. At this point, I ran o\u0000 and hid from them so that, although\n",

      "the owner of the house in Damascus, but after three years I found\n",
      "\n",
      "myself at a standstill and could not a\u0000ord more than the one year’s\n",
      "\n",
      "rent. So I set o\u0000 for Damascus and when I got there I stopped at my\n",

      "\n",
      "sealed up as I had left them. So I opened them and removed my\n",

      "shedding tears for some time. For two days I waited and then on the\n",

      "money at all with me and, on going to the market one day, I listened\n",

      "to the promptings of the devil, so that what was fated came to pass.\n",

      "without my knowledge, called for buyers. It turned out that the\n",

      "work, which will fetch a thousand dirhams.’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘we had it\n",
      "\n",

      "two days in a state of great distress and agitation. Then, on the third\n",
      "\n",
      "day, before I knew what was happening, he came back with a\n",
      "\n",
      "number of guards as well as the market superintendent, the man\n",
      "\n",
      "who claimed that I had stolen the necklace. I went out to meet them\n",
      "\n",
      "and asked: ‘What is the matter?’ Giving me no time to answer, they\n",
      "\n",
      "tied my arms and threw a chain around my neck. Then they told me\n",
      "\n",
      "that the necklace that had been in my possession had been taken to\n",
      "\n",
      "the governor of Damascus, who ruled the city as its vizier, and it\n",
      "\n",
      "appeared to have vanished from his palace three years ago, together\n",
      "\n",
      "with his daughter.\n",
      "\n",

      "no doubt that I am a dead man. I must tell the governor my story,\n",
      "\n",
      "and if he wants, he can kill me, or otherwise he may pardon me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When we came to him, I was made to stand before him. Looking at\n",
      "\n",
      "me out of the corner of his eye, he said to the people there: ‘Why\n",

      "did you cut his hand o\u0000? This is an unfortunate man who has\n",
      "\n",
      "committed no crime and you have wronged him by doing this.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard what he said, I took courage and my spirits rose. ‘By\n",
      "\n",
      "God, sir,’ I said, ‘I am no thief. They brought this grave accusation\n",
      "\n",
      "against me and beat me with whips in the middle of the market,\n",
      "\n",
      "forcing me to confess. So I told a lie against myself and admitted the\n",
      "\n",
      "theft, although I was innocent.’ ‘No harm shall come to you,’ he\n",

      "\n",
      "compensation for my hand: ‘Or else I shall hang you and con\u0000scate\n",
      "\n",
      "all your property.’ He then shouted to the o\u0000cers, who seized the\n",
      "\n",
      "man and dragged him o\u0000, leaving me with the governor.\n",
      "\n",
      "With his permission, guards removed the chain from my neck\n",

      "tell me the truth and explain to me how you got this necklace,’ and\n",
      "\n",
      "he recited:\n",

      "You must speak the truth, even if this truth\n",
      "\n",
      "Burns you with the promised \u0000re of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Promising that I would do this, I then told him what had happened\n",

      "to me with the \u0000rst girl and how she had brought me the second,\n",

      "Their victim remains sick until he dies.\n",

      "\n",
      "And the time before parting is short indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then came up to me and said: ‘My son, you must know that\n",
      "\n",
      "the elder girl was my daughter. I brought her up in strict seclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "and when she reached maturity, I sent her to Cairo, where she\n",
      "\n",
      "married her cousin. After his death she came back to me, but she\n",
      "\n",
      "had learned evil ways from the Egyptians and so it was that she\n",
      "\n",
      "went to you four times, \u0000nally bringing you her younger sister. They\n",
      "\n",
      "were full sisters and they loved each other deeply. After the elder\n",
      "\n",
      "had met you, she told her secret to her sister, who asked to go with\n",

      "myself in private how she had murdered the girl, and she kept on\n",
      "\n",
      "shedding tears and saying: ‘By God, I shall go on weeping for her\n",
      "\n",
      "until I die.’ That is how the matter stood, and now that you have\n",
      "\n",
      "seen what happened, I want you to agree to what I propose, which\n",

      "is to marry you to my youngest daughter. She is not a full sister of\n",

      "the other two and is a virgin. I shall not take any dowry from you;\n",
      "\n",
      "instead I shall make you an allowance and you can stay with me as\n",
      "\n",
      "my son.’ I agreed to this, saying: ‘How can it be that I have found\n",
      "\n",
      "such good fortune?’ The governor sent at once for the qadi and the\n",
      "\n",
      "notaries and he drew up the marriage contract, after which I\n",

      "Baghdad. He was wearing the \u0000nest of clothes and was remarkably\n",
      "\n",
      "good-looking, but he was lame. We stood up for him as he came in\n",
      "\n",
      "and greeted us, and he was about to take his seat when he caught\n",

      "sight of a barber who was with us. On seeing the man, he refused to\n",

      "responsible for my lameness and for the breaking of my leg. I swore\n",

      "that I would never associate with him in any place or in any town in\n",

      "When I had grown up and reached man’s estate, my father died,\n",

      "moving from this world to the mercy of Almighty God. He\n",

      "of women approached from the opposite direction, I ran o\u0000 and\n",

      "and disappeared from view. Fire was kindled in my heart and my\n",

      "mind was consumed by her, my hatred for women turning to love. I\n",
      "\n",
      "went on sitting there in a trance until sunset, when the qadi of\n",
      "\n",
      "Baghdad rode up, with his black slaves before him and his eunuchs\n",
      "\n",
      "behind. On dismounting, he went into the house from which the girl\n",
      "\n",
      "had gazed, and I realized that this must be her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went back sorrowfully to my own house and fell on my bed, full\n",

      "of care. My servant girls came in and sat around me, but they could\n",
      "\n",
      "not understand what was wrong with me and, as I said nothing to\n",

      "who, when she saw me, realized at once what the matter must be.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down by my head and spoke gently to me, saying: ‘My son,\n",

      "tell me about it and I shall see to it that you are united with her.’ I\n",
      "\n",
      "told her my story and she said: ‘My son, this is the daughter of the\n",

      "\n",
      "you saw her is on her \u0000oor of the building, while her father lives in\n",
      "\n",
      "a great hall beneath it. She sits by herself, but I often go to visit the\n",
      "\n",

      "her, so pluck up your courage.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I took heart from her words – that was a day of joy for my\n",

      "household – and in the morning I felt better. The old woman went\n",
      "\n",
      "o\u0000, but when she came back, her colour had changed. ‘My son,’ she\n",
      "\n",
      "said. ‘Don’t ask what happened between me and the girl. When I\n",
      "\n",
      "had spoken to her about you, she said: “You ill-omened old woman.\n",

      "the old woman came back. ‘My son,’ she said. ‘You must reward me\n",
      "\n",
      "for bringing good news.’ This restored me to life and I said: ‘You\n",

      "may have everything that is good.’ At that, she went on: ‘I went to\n",

      "\n",
      "“Aunt,” she asked, “why do you look so unhappy?” I wept and\n",

      "replied: “My lady, I have come to you from a young man who loves\n",
      "\n",
      "you and who is near to death because of you.” Her heart softened at\n",
      "\n",
      "this and she asked: “Where does he come from, this young man\n",
      "\n",
      "whom you have mentioned?” “He is like a son to me and the fruit of\n",

      "in love with you. The \u0000rst time that I told him what you had said to\n",
      "\n",
      "me, his love sickness grew worse; he kept to his bed, and there can\n",
      "\n",
      "be no doubt that he is going to die.” She turned pale. “Is all this\n",
      "\n",
      "because of me?” she asked. “Yes, by God,” I said, “so what should I\n",
      "\n",
      "do?” She said: “Go to him; greet him from me and let him know that\n",
      "\n",
      "my love is twice as great as his. Then tell him to come to the house\n",
      "\n",
      "on Friday before prayers. When he gets here, I shall go down and\n",
      "\n",
      "open the door and bring him up to my room. He and I can be\n",

      "from prayers.” ’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard what the old woman had to say, the pain that I was\n",

      "feeling left me and my spirits recovered. I gave her the clothes that I\n",
      "\n",
      "was wearing and she went o\u0000, telling me to be of good heart. ‘I have\n",
      "\n",
      "no pain left at all,’ I replied, and my household and my friends were\n",
      "\n",
      "delighted by my recovery. I stayed like that until Friday, when the\n",

      "good health, and then I put on my clothes, perfumed myself and\n",

      "especially after your serious illness? That would restore you.’ ‘A\n",

      "\n",
      "with men of learning and virtue. It happened that one feast day he\n",
      "\n",
      "became angry with ten men and ordered the prefect of Baghdad to\n",
      "\n",
      "bring them to him, they being thieves and highwaymen. The prefect\n",
      "\n",
      "went out, arrested them, and sent them o\u0000 in a boat. I saw this and\n",
      "\n",
      "said to myself: ‘These people must have gathered together for a\n",

      "drinking on their boat, and no one but I shall be their companion.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So I got up, and thanks to my sense of chivalry and the soundness of\n",
      "\n",
      "my intellect, I boarded this boat and mixed with them. They crossed\n",
      "\n",
      "the river and disembarked on the far bank. Then the watch and the\n",
      "\n",
      "guards brought chains which they placed round their necks, and\n",
      "\n",
      "they did the same to me. All this, my friends, was caused by my\n",
      "\n",
      "sense of chivalry and the fact that, as a man of few words, I kept\n",
      "\n",
      "silence and did not allow myself to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guards then took us by our chains and brought us before al-\n",

      "had ordered me to cut o\u0000 ten,’ the man replied. ‘I think that you\n",

      "silent at a time like this? How did you come to be with these\n",
      "\n",
      "criminals, and what is the reason for this, you being an old man of\n",
      "\n",
      "little brain?’ When I heard what he said, I told him: ‘You must\n",
      "\n",
      "know, Commander of the Faithful, that I am the silent shaikh. I have\n",
      "\n",
      "a large store of wisdom, and the soundness of my intelligence, the\n",
      "\n",
      "excellence of my understanding and my taciturnity are without\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "these ten men on their way to a boat, and I joined them, thinking\n",
      "\n",
      "that they had gathered together for a banquet. Shortly afterwards,\n",
      "\n",
      "the guards came and put chains around their necks, and they\n",
      "\n",
      "chained me together with the others. Because of my great sense of\n",
      "\n",
      "chivalry, I stayed silent and did not say a word, this being a simple\n",
      "\n",
      "matter of honour. They then took us o\u0000 and brought us before you\n",
      "\n",
      "and you ordered the execution of the ten. I stayed there in front of\n",
      "\n",
      "the executioner without telling you who I was. It was a hugely\n",
      "\n",
      "honourable act on my part to share in their execution, but all my\n",
      "\n",
      "days I have been doing favours of this kind to people, in spite of the\n",
      "\n",
      "fact that they repay me in the most brutish of ways.’\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing this, the caliph saw at once that I was a taciturn man\n",
      "\n",
      "with a great sense of chivalry, lacking in inquisitiveness, contrary to\n",
      "\n",
      "the claim made by this young man whom I saved from fearful\n",
      "\n",
      "danger. In fact, the caliph laughed so much that he fell over, and he\n",
      "\n",
      "asked me: ‘Silent man, are your six brothers as wise, learned and\n",
      "\n",
      "taciturn as you?’ ‘May they not stay alive,’ I said, ‘if they are like\n",
      "\n",
      "me. You are denigrating me, Commander of the Faithful, and you\n",
      "\n",
      "should not compare my brothers to me, as thanks to their loquacity\n",
      "\n",
      "and lack of honour, each of them has some physical deformity. One\n",

      "\n",
      "you that I have a greater sense of honour than they do, and each of\n",

      "\n",
      "The \u0000rst of them, the hunchback, was by trade a tailor in\n",
      "\n",
      "Baghdad. He used to do his sewing in a shop which he rented from a\n",
      "\n",
      "wealthy man who lived over the shop, while in the basement\n",
      "\n",
      "another man worked a mill. One day, when my brother the\n",

      "\n",
      "saw in the window of the house a woman like the full moon as it\n",

      "rises. She was looking out at the passers-by and when my brother\n",
      "\n",
      "saw her, love for her became \u0000xed in his heart. He spent that day\n",

      "before, so strengthening his love.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day, as he sat in his place looking at her, the woman\n",
      "\n",
      "caught sight of him and realized that he had been captivated by love\n",
      "\n",
      "for her. She smiled at him and he smiled at her. She then\n",
      "\n",
      "disappeared from sight and sent her maid to him with a bundle\n",
      "\n",
      "containing a quantity of red \u0000gured silk. When the maid came, she\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘My mistress greets you and asks you to use your skill to cut\n",

      "out a shift for her from this material and to sew it elegantly.’ My\n",
      "\n",
      "brother agreed to this and he cut out the shift and \u0000nished sewing it\n",

      "on that same day. Early the next morning, the maid came to him\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "night, as she herself was not able to sleep because she was\n",
      "\n",
      "concerned for you.’ Then she produced for him some yellow satin\n",

      "a pair of harem trousers and to sew them up today.’ My brother\n",

      "money. My brother said nothing, but the lady made signs to him\n",
      "\n",
      "that he should take none of it. So he said: ‘By God, I shall not ask\n",

      "work was going. ‘The shirts are \u0000nished,’ he had replied, and he had\n",
      "\n",

      "So the next morning, when my brother went to his shop, the maid\n",

      "order to get him to turn the millwheel. At midnight, the miller came\n",
      "\n",
      "in and started to say: ‘This bull is lazy; he has stopped and isn’t\n",
      "\n",
      "turning the wheel tonight, in spite of the fact that we have a great\n",

      "deal of corn.’ He came down to the mill, \u0000lled the trough with\n",
      "\n",
      "grain, and then went up to my brother carrying a rope which he tied\n",
      "\n",
      "round his neck. ‘Hup,’ he cried, ‘turn the millstone over the grain.\n",
      "\n",
      "All you do is eat and leave your droppings and your urine.’ He then\n",
      "\n",
      "took up a whip and lashed my brother with it. My brother wept and\n",
      "\n",
      "cried out, but could \u0000nd no one to help him, and the grinding\n",
      "\n",
      "continued until it was almost morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owner of the house then came but went o\u0000 again after seeing\n",
      "\n",
      "my brother tethered to the millwheel. Early in the day, the maid\n",
      "\n",
      "arrived and professed to be shocked by what had happened to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My mistress and I were worried about you.’ Because of his tiredness\n",
      "\n",
      "and the severity of his beating, my brother could give no answer in\n",

      "return. When he got back to his lodging, in came the o\u0000cial who\n",
      "\n",
      "had drawn up the marriage contract. The man greeted him and said:\n",
      "\n",

      "and night-long embraces.’ ‘May God give no blessing to the liar, you\n",

      "thousand-time cuckold,’ retorted my brother. ‘By God, I have been\n",
      "\n",
      "doing nothing but grind corn in place of the bull until morning.’ The\n",
      "\n",
      "o\u0000cial asked him to tell his story, which he did, and the man then\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘Your star did not match hers, but if you like, I can alter the\n",
      "\n",

      "trick on you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, he left my brother, who went to his shop to see if\n",
      "\n",
      "anyone would bring him work from which he could get money to\n",
      "\n",
      "buy food. Again, the maid came and asked him to go to her mistress,\n",
      "\n",
      "but this time he said: ‘Go away, my good girl; I will have no further\n",
      "\n",
      "dealings with your mistress.’ The girl went o\u0000 and told her mistress\n",
      "\n",
      "of this, and before my brother knew what was happening, she was\n",
      "\n",
      "looking out at him from her window, weeping and saying: ‘My\n",
      "\n",
      "darling, why will you have nothing more to do with me?’ He made\n",
      "\n",
      "no reply, and she then swore that nothing that had happened in the\n",
      "\n",
      "mill had been of her choosing and that she hadn’t had anything to\n",
      "\n",
      "do with it.\n",

      "When my brother looked at her loveliness and grace and listened\n",

      "to her sweet words, he forgot his su\u0000erings, accepted her excuse and\n",
      "\n",
      "took pleasure in gazing at her. He greeted her and talked with her,\n",
      "\n",
      "after which he sat for a time doing his sewing. When the maid came\n",
      "\n",
      "this time, she said: ‘My mistress greets you and tells you that her\n",

      "\n",
      "to them, you can come to us and pass the most delicious of nights\n",
      "\n",
      "with her until morning.’ In fact, her husband had asked her how\n",
      "\n",
      "they could get my brother to leave her alone, and she had said: ‘Let\n",
      "\n",
      "me play another trick on him and I will see that his shame is known\n",
      "\n",
      "throughout this city.’\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother knew nothing of women’s wiles, and so when the\n",

      "maid came that evening, he went o\u0000 with her. When the lady saw\n",
      "\n",
      "him, she said: ‘I am full of passionate longing for you.’ ‘For God’s\n",

      "sake,’ he said, ‘give me a kiss at once,’ but before he had \u0000nished\n",
      "\n",
      "speaking, in came her husband from another room. ‘By God,’ he said\n",

      "to my brother, ‘I’m going to take you straight to the chief of police.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Paying no attention to my brother’s pleadings, he carried him o\u0000 to\n",

      "the wali, who had him beaten with whips, mounted on a camel and\n",
      "\n",
      "taken round the city, with the people shouting at him: ‘This is the\n",

      "banished from the city and went out without knowing where to go,\n",
      "\n",
      "but, as I was afraid for him, I caught up with him and stayed with\n",

      "him. Then I brought him back and lodged him in my house, where\n",

      "what happened to my other brothers, adding: ‘But do not think that\n",

      "I am loquacious.’ I CONTINUED:\n",

      "You must know, Commander of the Faithful, that my second\n",

      "brother is called the Babbler and it is he who is semi-paralysed. One\n",
      "\n",
      "day when he was walking along on some errand of his, he met an\n",
      "\n",
      "old woman who asked him to stop for a moment so that she could\n",
      "\n",
      "propose something to him, adding: ‘And if you like the sound of it,\n",
      "\n",
      "then do it for me, with God’s guidance.’ He stopped and she went\n",
      "\n",
      "on: ‘I shall tell you of something and guide you to it, but you must\n",
      "\n",
      "not question me too much.’ ‘Tell me,’ said my brother, and she\n",
      "\n",
      "asked: ‘What do you say to a beautiful house with a pleasant garden,\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000owing streams, fruit, wine, a beautiful face and someone to\n",
      "\n",
      "embrace you from evening until morning? If you do what I shall\n",
      "\n",
      "suggest to you, you will \u0000nd something to please you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When my brother heard this, he said: ‘My lady, how is it that you\n",
      "\n",
      "have singled me out from everybody else in this a\u0000air, and what is\n",
      "\n",
      "it about me that has pleased you?’ ‘Didn’t I tell you not to talk too\n",
      "\n",
      "much?’ she said. ‘Be quiet and come with me.’ She then turned back\n",
      "\n",
      "and my brother followed her, hoping to see what she had described.\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered a spacious house with many servants, and after she\n",
      "\n",
      "had taken him from the bottom to the top of it, he saw that it was\n",
      "\n",
      "an elegant mansion. When the members of the household saw him,\n",
      "\n",
      "they asked: ‘Who has brought you here?’ ‘Don’t talk to him,’ said the\n",
      "\n",
      "old woman, ‘and don’t worry him. He is a craftsman and we need\n",
      "\n",
      "him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She then took him to a beautifully decorated room, as lovely as\n",
      "\n",
      "eye had ever seen. When they entered, the women there got up,\n",
      "\n",
      "welcomed him and made him sit beside them. Immediately he heard\n",
      "\n",
      "a great commotion, and in came maids, in the middle of whom was\n",
      "\n",
      "a girl like the moon on the night it comes to the full. My brother\n",
      "\n",
      "turned to look at her and then got up and made his obeisance. She\n",
      "\n",
      "welcomed him, telling him to sit down, and after he had done this,\n",
      "\n",
      "she went up to him and said: ‘May God honour you, is all well with\n",
      "\n",
      "you?’ ‘Very well indeed,’ replied my brother. Then she ordered food\n",
      "\n",
      "to be brought, and a delicious meal was produced for him. She sat\n",
      "\n",
      "and joined him in eating it, but all the while she could not stop\n",
      "\n",
      "laughing, although whenever he looked at her, she turned away to\n",
      "\n",
      "her maids as though she was laughing at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made a show of a\u0000ection for him and joked with him, while\n",
      "\n",
      "he, donkey that he is, understood nothing. He was so far under the\n",
      "\n",
      "in\u0000uence of desire that he thought that the girl was in love with him\n",
      "\n",
      "and that she would allow him his wish. After they had \u0000nished\n",
      "\n",
      "eating, wine was produced, and then ten maids like moons came\n",
      "\n",
      "with stringed lutes in their hands and they started to sing with great\n",
      "\n",
      "emotion. Overcome by delight, my brother took a glass from the\n",
      "\n",
      "girl’s hand and drained it, before standing up. The girl then drank a\n",
      "\n",
      "glass. ‘Good health,’ said my brother, and he made her another\n",
      "\n",
      "obeisance. She then gave him a second glass to drink, but when he\n",
      "\n",
      "did this, she slapped him on the nape of his neck. At that my\n",
      "\n",
      "brother left the room as fast as he could, but the old woman\n",
      "\n",
      "followed him and started winking at him, as if to tell him to go\n",
      "\n",
      "back. So back he went, and when the girl told him to sit down, he\n",
      "\n",
      "sat without a word. She then slapped him again on the nape of his\n",
      "\n",
      "neck and, not content with that, she ordered all her maids to slap\n",
      "\n",
      "him. All the while he was saying to the old woman: ‘I have never\n",
      "\n",
      "seen anything \u0000ner than this,’ while she was exclaiming to her\n",
      "\n",
      "mistress that that was enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the maids went on slapping him until he was almost\n",
      "\n",
      "unconscious. When he had to get up to answer the call of nature, the\n",
      "\n",
      "old woman caught up with him and said: ‘A little endurance and\n",
      "\n",
      "you will get what you want.’ ‘How long do I have to endure,’ he\n",
      "\n",
      "asked, ‘now that I have been slapped almost unconscious?’ ‘When\n",
      "\n",
      "she gets drunk,’ the old woman told him, ‘you will get what you\n",
      "\n",
      "want.’ So my brother went back and sat down in his place. All the\n",
      "\n",
      "maids stood up and their mistress told them to perfume my brother\n",
      "\n",
      "and to sprinkle rosewater over his face. When they had done this,\n",
      "\n",
      "the girl said: ‘May God bring you honour. You have entered my\n",
      "\n",
      "house and endured the condition I imposed. Whoever disobeys me, I\n",
      "\n",
      "expel, but whoever endures reaches his goal.’ ‘I am your slave, lady,’\n",
      "\n",
      "said my brother, ‘and you hold me in the palm of your hand.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Know,’ she replied, ‘that God has made me passionately fond of\n",
      "\n",
      "amusement, and those who indulge me in this get what they seek.’\n",
      "\n",
      "On her orders, the maids sang with loud voices until all present\n",
      "\n",
      "were \u0000lled with delight. She then said to one of them: ‘Take your\n",
      "\n",
      "master, do what needs to be done to him and then bring him back\n",
      "\n",
      "immediately.’ The maid took my brother, little knowing what was\n",
      "\n",
      "going to be done to him. He was joined by the old woman, who\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘Be patient; you will not have to wait long.’ His face cleared\n",
      "\n",
      "and he went with the maid, heeding the words of the old woman\n",
      "\n",
      "telling him that patience would bring him his desire. He then asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is the maid going to do?’ ‘No harm will come to you,’ said the\n",
      "\n",
      "old woman, ‘may I be your ransom. She is going to dye your\n",
      "\n",
      "eyebrows and pluck out your moustache.’ ‘Dye on the eyebrows can\n",
      "\n",
      "be washed away,’ said my brother, ‘but plucking out a moustache is\n",
      "\n",
      "a painful business.’ ‘Take care not to disobey her,’ said the old lady,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘for her heart is \u0000xed on you.’ So my brother patiently allowed his\n",
      "\n",
      "eyebrows to be dyed and his moustache plucked. The maid went to\n",
      "\n",
      "her mistress and told her of this, but her mistress said: ‘There is one\n",
      "\n",
      "thing more. You have to shave his chin so as to leave him beardless.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid returned to tell my brother of her mistress’s order, and\n",
      "\n",
      "he, the fool, objected: ‘But won’t this make me a public disgrace?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman explained: ‘She only wants to do that to you so that\n",
      "\n",
      "you may be smooth and beardless, with nothing on your face that\n",
      "\n",
      "might prick her, for she has fallen most deeply in love with you. So\n",
      "\n",
      "be patient, for you will get what you want.’ Patiently my brother\n",
      "\n",
      "submitted to the maid and let his beard be shaved. The girl then had\n",
      "\n",
      "him brought out, with his dyed eyebrows, his shorn moustache, his\n",
      "\n",
      "shaven chin and his red face. At \u0000rst, the lady recoiled from him in\n",
      "\n",
      "alarm, but then she laughed until she fell over. ‘My master,’ she\n",
      "\n",
      "said, ‘you have won me by your good nature.’ Then she urged him\n",
      "\n",
      "to get up and dance, which he did, and there was not a cushion in\n",
      "\n",
      "the room that she did not throw at him, while the maids began to\n",
      "\n",
      "pelt him with oranges, lemons and citrons, until he fell fainting from\n",
      "\n",
      "the blows, the cu\u0000s that he had su\u0000ered on the back of his neck and\n",
      "\n",
      "the things that had been thrown at him.\n",
      "\n",

      "said: ‘Brothers, I want to take out some of the money that I still have\n",

      "buried. They then produced some food and sat eating, but my\n",

      "you will \u0000nd out nothing except by torture. So start by torturing me\n",
      "\n",

      "went on beating him, he opened the other. ‘What’s this, you damned\n",

      "fellow?’ said the wali. ‘Give me a guarantee of protection,’ said the\n",

      "people, entering their homes, looking at their women and\n",
      "\n",
      "corrupting them. This has proved very pro\u0000table and we have\n",
      "\n",
      "collected twelve thousand dirhams. I told my companions to give\n",
      "\n",
      "me my share, that is three thousand dirhams, but instead, they beat\n",
      "\n",
      "me and took my money. I take refuge with God and with you, but I\n",

      "me and they will open their eyes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "At that, the wali ordered the blind men to be beaten, starting\n",

      "pretend to be blind?’ ‘God, God, by God,’ cried my brother, ‘not one\n",
      "\n",
      "of us can see,’ but they beat him until he fainted. ‘Leave him until\n",
      "\n",
      "he recovers,’ said the wali, ‘and then beat him again.’ He went on to\n",
      "\n",
      "order that each of the others be given more than three hundred\n",
      "\n",
      "lashes, while the house owner kept urging: ‘Open your eyes, or else\n",
      "\n",
      "you will be beaten again.’ Then he said to the wali: ‘Send someone\n",
      "\n",
      "with me to fetch the money, for these men will not open their eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "as they are afraid of public disgrace.’ The wali did this and, after\n",
      "\n",
      "getting the money, he gave the house owner three thousand dirhams\n",
      "\n",
      "which he had claimed as his share, keeping the rest for himself, and\n",
      "\n",
      "he then exiled the three blind men. I went out and caught up with\n",
      "\n",
      "my brother and asked him what had happened to him. When he told\n",
      "\n",
      "me the story that I have just told you, I took him back into the city\n",
      "\n",
      "secretly and, still in secret, I gave him an allowance for food and\n",
      "\n",
      "drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "The caliph laughed at the story and ordered that I should be given a\n",
      "\n",
      "reward and allowed to leave, but I told him: ‘By God, I will not take\n",
      "\n",
      "anything until I tell the Commander of the Faithful what happened\n",

      "to my other brothers, for I am a taciturn man.’ THEN I SAID:\n",
      "\n",
      "My fourth brother, who is now one-eyed, was a butcher in\n",
      "\n",
      "Baghdad who sold meat and raised rams. Men of importance and\n",
      "\n",
      "wealth used to seek him out and buy meat from him, as a result of\n",
      "\n",
      "which he became very wealthy and acquired both riding beasts and\n",
      "\n",
      "houses. This good fortune lasted for a long time. Then one day,\n",
      "\n",
      "when he was sitting in his shop, an old man with a long beard\n",
      "\n",
      "stopped beside him, gave him some money and asked for its value in\n",
      "\n",
      "meat. When the exchange of money and meat had been made, the\n",
      "\n",
      "old man went o\u0000.\n",
      "\n",
      "On looking at the silver that he been given, my brother saw that\n",
      "\n",
      "the dirhams were glistening white, so he stored them by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "For \u0000ve months, the old man kept coming back and my brother\n",
      "\n",
      "went on putting his dirhams in a box by themselves. He then\n",
      "\n",
      "wanted to take them out in order to buy some sheep, but when he\n",
      "\n",
      "opened the box, he found that all it contained was white paper cut\n",
      "\n",
      "in pieces. He struck his face and cried out, and when a crowd\n",
      "\n",
      "gathered around him he told them his story, which \u0000lled them with\n",
      "\n",
      "astonishment. Following his usual practice, my brother then got up\n",
      "\n",
      "and slaughtered a ram whose carcass he hung up in his shop, while\n",
      "\n",
      "the meat that he had sliced from it he hung up outside, saying as he\n",
      "\n",
      "did so: ‘O God, let that ill-omened old man come.’ In fact, some time\n",
      "\n",
      "later, the man did arrive, bringing silver with him. My brother got\n",
      "\n",
      "up and, holding on to him, shouted: ‘Muslims, come here and listen\n",
      "\n",
      "to what I have to tell you about this evil-doer.’ When the old man\n",
      "\n",
      "heard this, he said to my brother: ‘Which would you prefer – to\n",
      "\n",
      "leave me alone or to be publicly shamed by me?’ ‘How can you\n",
      "\n",
      "shame me?’ asked my brother. ‘By showing that you are selling\n",
      "\n",
      "human \u0000esh as mutton,’ said the old man. ‘You are lying, you\n",
      "\n",
      "damned fellow,’ my brother replied. ‘The one who is damned is the\n",
      "\n",
      "one who has a man hung up in his shop.’ ‘If that is so,’ said my\n",
      "\n",
      "brother, ‘then my money and my blood are lawfully yours.’\n",
      "\n",
      "At that, the old man called to the bystanders: ‘If you want to\n",
      "\n",
      "check what I say to \u0000nd that I am telling the truth, then come into\n",
      "\n",
      "his shop.’ The people surged forward and found that the ram had\n",
      "\n",
      "become a man, whose corpse was hanging there. When they saw\n",
      "\n",
      "that, they laid hold of my brother and shouted at him: ‘In\u0000del,\n",
      "\n",
      "villain,’ while his dearest friend started hitting and slapping him and\n",
      "\n",
      "saying: ‘Do you give us human \u0000esh to eat?’ The old man struck him\n",
      "\n",
      "on the eye and knocked it out. Then the people took the corpse to\n",
      "\n",
      "the chief of police, to whom the old man said: ‘Emir, this man\n",

      "slaughters people and sells their \u0000esh as mutton. We have brought\n",
      "\n",
      "him to you, so do you punish him in accordance with the law of the\n",
      "\n",
      "Omnipotent and All-powerful God.’ My brother tried to defend\n",
      "\n",
      "himself, but the police chief would not listen and ordered him to be\n",
      "\n",
      "given \u0000ve hundred lashes. All his money was con\u0000scated, and had it\n",
      "\n",
      "not been for the money, he would have been killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then \u0000ed away as fast as he could and eventually he reached\n",
      "\n",
      "a large city where he thought it best to set up as a shoemaker. He\n",
      "\n",
      "opened a shop and sat working for his daily bread. One day, he\n",
      "\n",
      "went out on some errand. Hearing the sound of horses’ hooves, he\n",
      "\n",
      "asked what was happening, and he was told that the king was going\n",
      "\n",
      "out hunting. My brother was gazing at his splendour when, on\n",
      "\n",
      "noticing him, the king lowered his head and said: ‘God is my refuge\n",
      "\n",
      "from the evil of this day.’ He turned his horse about and rode back\n",
      "\n",
      "with all his retinue. He then gave orders to his servants, who got\n",
      "\n",
      "hold of my brother and beat him so painfully that he almost died.\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother didn’t know why they had done this and returned\n",
      "\n",
      "home in a state of near collapse. Later he approached one of the\n",
      "\n",
      "king’s household and told him what had happened. The man\n",
      "\n",
      "laughed until he fell over and then said: ‘Brother, you must know\n",
      "\n",
      "that the king cannot bear to look at a one-eyed man, especially if it\n",
      "\n",
      "is the right eye that he has lost, in which case he doesn’t let him go\n",
      "\n",
      "free, but kills him.’ On hearing this, my brother made up his mind to\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000ee from the city. He got up and left for another part where no one\n",
      "\n",
      "knew him, and there he stayed for a long time. Then, while thinking\n",
      "\n",
      "over his situation, he went out one day to see the sights, but on\n",
      "\n",
      "hearing the sound of horses behind him, he cried: ‘My fate has come\n",
      "\n",
      "upon me!’ He looked for a place to hide, but could \u0000nd nothing until\n",
      "\n",
      "he caught sight of a door. Pushing it open, he went in. There he saw\n",
      "\n",
      "a long hallway, which he entered, but before he knew what was\n",
      "\n",
      "going on, two men had laid hold on him. ‘Praise to God,’ they said,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘for thanks to Him we have laid our hands on you, you enemy of\n",
      "\n",
      "God. For three nights now, thanks to you, we have had no sleep and\n",
      "\n",
      "no rest, and you have given us a taste of the pangs of death.’ ‘What\n",
      "\n",
      "is the matter with you people?’ asked my brother. ‘You have been\n",

      "him and she played with him for a time.\n",

      "clothes and went on beating him with the \u0000at of his sword until he\n",

      "out on the other side. God granted him shelter; it was dark as he\n",

      "of this. My brother then told of his adventure with the old woman\n",
      "\n",
      "from beginning to end and of the \u0000ight of the lady. He added: ‘Take\n",

      "\n",
      "out in search of something with which to keep body and soul\n",
      "\n",
      "together. On his way, he caught sight of a \u0000ne house, with a wide\n",
      "\n",
      "and lofty portico and eunuchs at the door, having all the trappings\n",
      "\n",
      "of authority. In answer to his question, a bystander told him that the\n",
      "\n",
      "house belonged to one of the Barmecides. He approached the\n",
      "\n",
      "doorkeepers and asked them for alms. ‘Go in through the main\n",

      "So my brother entered the portico and walked through until he\n",

      "\n",
      "and adorned with hangings, in the middle of which was a garden\n",
      "\n",
      "whose like he had never seen before. He looked round in\n",
      "\n",
      "bewilderment, not knowing where to go, and he then advanced to\n",
      "\n",
      "the head of the room, where he saw a man, bearded and with a\n",
      "\n",
      "handsome face, who stood up to greet him. The man asked him how\n",
      "\n",
      "he was, and my brother told him that he was in need. On hearing\n",
      "\n",
      "this, the other showed great concern, and stretching out his hand to\n",

      "his clothes, he tore them, saying: ‘Are you to be hungry in a town in\n",

      "\n",
      "not to be ashamed, after which he himself pretended to be eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept saying to my brother: ‘I am surprised at your lack of\n",

      "\n",
      "My brother started to make a pretence of eating as his host urged\n",
      "\n",
      "him on, saying: ‘Eat up and try this beautiful white bread.’ As my\n",
      "\n",
      "brother could see nothing, he said to himself: ‘This fellow likes\n",
      "\n",
      "making a fool of people.’ Out loud he said: ‘Never in my life, sir,\n",
      "\n",
      "have I come across whiter or more delicious bread.’ ‘It was baked,’\n",
      "\n",
      "replied the host, ‘by a slave girl whom I bought for \u0000ve hundred\n",

      "dinars.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He then called out: ‘Bring the \u0000rst course, the pie, and put lots of\n",
      "\n",
      "fat on it.’ Turning to my brother, he asked whether he had ever seen\n",
      "\n",
      "anything more delicious, urging him again to eat up and not be\n",
      "\n",
      "ashamed. Next, he called for ‘the stew with the fatted sandgrouse’.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Guest,’ he said to my brother, ‘start eating, for you are hungry and\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Nothing came, but he kept on urging my brother to eat. Eventually\n",

      "\n",
      "‘By your life, my guest,’ he said, ‘these chickens have been fattened\n",
      "\n",
      "on pistachio nuts. You will have never tasted the like before, so eat\n",

      "up.’ ‘This is excellent, sir,’ agreed my brother, and the man began to\n",
      "\n",
      "move his hand towards my brother’s mouth, as though he was\n",
      "\n",
      "giving him mouthfuls to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept on enumerating particular types of food and describing\n",
      "\n",
      "them to my hungry brother, who grew even hungrier and longed for\n",
      "\n",
      "a barley loaf. ‘Have you come across anything more tasty than the\n",
      "\n",
      "seasoning of these dishes?’ asked his host, and when my brother\n",
      "\n",
      "said no, he urged him to eat heartily and not to be ashamed. When\n",
      "\n",
      "my brother said that he had had enough food, the servants were told\n",
      "\n",
      "to remove the dishes and bring in the desserts. ‘Take some of this to\n",
      "\n",
      "eat. It is good,’ said the man. ‘Eat some of these doughnuts. Take\n",

      "this one before the syrup runs out of it.’ ‘Sir, may I never be\n",
      "\n",
      "deprived of you,’ said my brother, and he then started to ask his\n",

      "custom,’ replied the other. ‘My people put a mithqal of musk in each\n",

      "\n",
      "shy’ – but my brother said that he had had enough and could not eat\n",

      "hungry?’\n",

      "doing this. The man then gave my brother a cup and said: ‘Take this\n",

      "and tell me if you like it.’ ‘It has a \u0000ne bouquet,’ said my brother,\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "better to drink.’ My brother thanked him, and moved his hand as\n",
      "\n",
      "though he was drinking. ‘Cheers and good health,’ he said, and the\n",
      "\n",
      "host, too, pretended to drink. Then he gave my brother another cup\n",
      "\n",
      "to drink, and my brother, pretending to be drunk, took him\n",
      "\n",
      "unawares, and lifting his arm until his armpit was bared, he gave\n",
      "\n",
      "him a resounding slap on the nape of the neck, following this up\n",
      "\n",
      "with another one. ‘What’s this, you scum?’ said the man. ‘Sir,’\n",
      "\n",
      "replied my brother, ‘you have been generous to your servant. You\n",
      "\n",
      "have taken him into your house, given him food to eat and old wine\n",
      "\n",
      "to drink, but he has become drunk and attacked you like a hooligan.\n",

      "never leave me.’ He then ordered a number of the dishes that he had\n",
      "\n",
      "mentioned earlier to be brought out and he and my brother ate until\n",
      "\n",
      "they had had their \u0000ll. They then moved to the drinking room,\n",
      "\n",
      "where slave girls like moons sang tunes of all kinds to a variety of\n",

      "instruments, and they drank until drunkenness overcame them. The\n",
      "\n",
      "man became so friendly with his guest that the two of them were\n",
      "\n",
      "like brothers. Out of his deep a\u0000ection for him, the host gave my\n",

      "possessions, and as a result of this my brother was left poor and\n",

      "powerless. Accordingly, he \u0000ed away, but in the course of his\n",

      "you want to corrupt my wife,’ and he took out a knife and cut o\u0000\n",

      "said. ‘Yes,’ he replied, and she then repeated to him what his son\n",
      "\n",
      "had done. He tore his clothes in grief, slapped his face and plucked\n",
      "\n",
      "out his beard. ‘Don’t kill yourself,’ urged his wife. ‘I shall give you\n",

      "her, for you have a better right to her than the sultan.’ So he took\n",

      "\n",
      "for Nur al-Din, he was afraid of what might happen. He stayed all\n",
      "\n",
      "day long in the orchard and at the end of the day he came to his\n",

      "\n",
      "dawn and going back to the orchard. For a month, he carried on like\n",
      "\n",
      "this, not showing his face to his father. Then his mother said to his\n",

      "father: ‘Master, are we going to lose our son as well as the girl? If\n",
      "\n",
      "this goes on for too long, he will run away from us.’ ‘What are we to\n",

      "then came up and cried: ‘What are you going to do to our son?’ ‘I\n",

      "\n",
      "I may have sinned but men of understanding\n",

      "swore an oath on this. He then went in to join Anis al-Jalis and\n",
      "\n",
      "stayed with her for a year, while God Almighty caused the king to\n",
      "\n",
      "forget that he had wanted a slave girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for al-Mu‘in, the story had come to his ears, but since his\n",
      "\n",
      "fellow vizier stood so high in the sultan’s favour, he did not dare to\n",
      "\n",
      "speak about it. At the end of a year, al-Fadl went to the baths, but\n",
      "\n",
      "he was still sweating when he came out and the fresh air proved\n",
      "\n",
      "harmful to him. He took to his bed and spent long sleepless hours as\n",
      "\n",
      "his illness grew worse and worse. He then summoned Nur al-Din\n",
      "\n",
      "and, when he came, he said: ‘Know, my son, that what God gives us\n",
      "\n",
      "as our daily bread is apportioned to us, that our allotted time is\n",
      "\n",
      "decreed by fate and that every living soul must drink of the cup of\n",
      "\n",
      "death.’ Then he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a mortal: great is the Immortal God!\n",
      "\n",
      "I know for sure that I shall die.\n",
      "\n",
      "No mortal keeps his kingdom when he dies;\n",
      "\n",
      "The kingdom belongs to Him Who does not die.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have no instruction to give you, my son, except to fear God, to\n",

      "think about the consequences of your actions, and to do what I told\n",
      "\n",
      "you about the slave girl, Anis al-Jalis.’ ‘Father,’ said Nur al-Din,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘who is your equal? You are known for your charitable acts, and\n",
      "\n",
      "preachers bless you from their pulpits.’ ‘My son,’ his father said, ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "hope to \u0000nd acceptance with Almighty God.’ Then he pronounced\n",
      "\n",
      "the two confessions of faith and was enrolled among the blessed. At\n",
      "\n",
      "that, his palace was turned upside down with cries of mourning.\n",
      "\n",
      "News reached the sultan; the people heard of al-Fadl’s death and\n",
      "\n",
      "children wept for him in their schools. Nur al-Din, his son, got up\n",
      "\n",
      "and made preparations for the funeral, which was attended by the\n",
      "\n",
      "emirs, o\u0000cers of state and the people of the city, while among those\n",
      "\n",
      "who came was the vizier al-Mu‘in.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the funeral cortège left the house, someone recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "On Thursday I parted from my friends;\n",
      "\n",
      "They washed me on a stone slab by the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "They stripped me of the clothes that I had on,\n",
      "\n",
      "Dressing me in what was not my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the shoulders of four men they carried me\n",
      "\n",
      "To the chapel, where people prayed for me,\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a prayer where there is no prostration.\n",
      "\n",
      "All my friends prayed over me, and then\n",
      "\n",
      "They went with me into a vaulted house,\n",
      "\n",
      "Whose door shall not be opened, though Time wears all away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the earth had been heaped over the corpse and his family\n",
      "\n",
      "and friends had left, Nur al-Din went back home, sobbing and\n",
      "\n",
      "tearful, and reciting in his distress:\n",
      "\n",
      "They left on a Thursday evening;\n",
      "\n",
      "I said goodbye to them and they to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had turned away, my soul went with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Return,’ I told it, but it said: ‘To where should I return –\n",
      "\n",
      "To a bloodless body with no breath of life,\n",
      "\n",
      "That is no more than rattling bones?\n",
      "\n",
      "My eyes are blinded by the violence of my tears;\n",
      "\n",
      "My ears are deaf and cannot hear.’\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, he remained in deep mourning for his father,\n",
      "\n",
      "until one day, when he was seated in his father’s house, a knock\n",
      "\n",
      "came at the door. He rose and opened it, to \u0000nd one of his father’s\n",
      "\n",
      "intimate friends and companions. The man came in, kissed his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "and said: ‘One who has left behind a son like you is not dead, and\n",
      "\n",
      "this is a path trodden by Muhammad, the master of all generations\n",
      "\n",
      "of mankind, earlier and later. Be of good heart, sir, and abandon\n",
      "\n",
      "your mourning.’ At that, Nur al-Din got up, went to the reception\n",
      "\n",
      "room and brought there all that was needed. His companions\n",
      "\n",
      "gathered around him, including ten young merchants, and he took\n",
      "\n",
      "his slave girl and began to eat and drink and to hold one\n",
      "\n",
      "entertainment after another, making generous gifts. His agent then\n",
      "\n",
      "came to him and said: ‘Sir, have you not heard it said that whoever\n",
      "\n",
      "spends without keeping a reckoning, becomes poor before he knows\n",
      "\n",
      "it? As the poet says:\n",
      "\n",
      "I act as guardian and defend my cash,\n",
      "\n",
      "For this, I know, serves as my sword and shield.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I spend it on my most bitter foes,\n",
      "\n",
      "I exchange good fortune among men for bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spend on food and drink with happiness,\n",
      "\n",
      "Giving away no single coin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guard my money from mean-natured folk,\n",
      "\n",
      "Those people who are no true friends of mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like this more than saying to some low man:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give me a dirham till tomorrow in exchange for \u0000ve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He would shun me, turning away his face,\n",
      "\n",
      "While my soul would be like that of a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men without money are disgraced,\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if their virtues shine out like the sun.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The agent went on: ‘Master, this enormous expenditure and these\n",
      "\n",
      "huge gifts are destroying your wealth.’ When Nur al-Din heard what\n",
      "\n",
      "his agent had to say, he looked at him and said: ‘I shall not pay\n",
      "\n",
      "attention to a single word of yours, for I have heard what the poet\n",
      "\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I have money which I do not give away,\n",
      "\n",
      "May my hand wither and my foot not stir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Find me a man whose meanness won him fame,\n",
      "\n",
      "Or one who died of generosity.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he told the man: ‘If you have enough left for my morning\n",
      "\n",
      "meal, then don’t worry me about what to eat in the evening.’ The\n",
      "\n",
      "agent left him, while he himself set about enjoying the life of\n",
      "\n",
      "pleasure on which he had embarked. Whenever one of his\n",
      "\n",
      "companions said: ‘This is a beautiful thing,’ he would say: ‘It is\n",
      "\n",
      "yours as a gift,’ and if someone else said: ‘Such-and-such a house is\n",
      "\n",
      "beautiful,’ he would reply: ‘I give it to you.’ Both \u0000rst thing and last\n",
      "\n",
      "thing each day, he would give entertainments, and for a whole year\n",
      "\n",
      "he continued in this way. Then, after a year was up, Anis al-Jalis\n",
      "\n",
      "came and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "You thought well of Time when Time was kind,\n",
      "\n",
      "You did not fear the evils fate might bring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nights kept peace with you; you were deceived.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is when the nights are undisturbed that distress comes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had \u0000nished these lines, there was a knock on the\n",
      "\n",
      "door. Nur al-Din got up, followed, although he did not know it, by\n",
      "\n",
      "one of his companions. When he opened the door, he found his\n",
      "\n",
      "agent, and when he asked what news he had, the agent said: ‘What I\n",
      "\n",
      "feared for you has happened.’ ‘How is that?’ asked Nur al-Din.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Know,’ replied the man, ‘that I have nothing at my disposal worth a\n",
      "\n",
      "dirham, neither more nor less. Here are the account books showing\n",
      "\n",
      "your expenditure, and these are the ones that show your original\n",
      "\n",
      "capital.’ On hearing this, Nur al-Din looked down at the ground and\n",
      "\n",
      "exclaimed: ‘There is no might and no power except with God!’ The\n",
      "\n",
      "man who had secretly followed him was there to spy on him, and\n",
      "\n",
      "when he had heard what the agent had to say, he returned to his\n",
      "\n",
      "companions and told them: ‘Mind what you do, for Nur al-Din is\n",
      "\n",
      "bankrupt.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Nur al-Din returned, his distress was plainly written on his\n",
      "\n",
      "face. One of his drinking companions then got to his feet, looked at\n",
      "\n",
      "him, and asked politely for leave to go. ‘Why do you want to go?’\n",
      "\n",
      "asked Nur al-Din. ‘My wife is giving birth and I cannot be away\n",
      "\n",
      "from her. I would like to go and see her,’ replied the man. When\n",
      "\n",
      "Nur al-Din gave him leave, another stood up and said that he\n",
      "\n",
      "wanted to go to his brother, who was circumcising his son, and then\n",
      "\n",
      "everyone produced some excuse to leave, until eventually they had\n",
      "\n",
      "all gone and Nur al-Din was left alone. He called for Anis al-Jalis\n",
      "\n",
      "and said: ‘Do you see what has happened to me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "He told her about the agent’s news and she said: ‘For some nights\n",
      "\n",
      "now I have been thinking of talking to you about this, but I heard\n",
      "\n",
      "you reciting:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the world is generous to you, be generous with your worldly\n",
      "\n",
      "goods,\n",
      "\n",
      "And give to everyone before good fortune goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generosity will not destroy your luck,\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor will meanness retain it when it turns away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard you speak these lines, I stayed silent and said\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Nur al-Din then pointed out: ‘You know that it is only to my\n",
      "\n",
      "companions that I have given away my wealth. They have left me\n",
      "\n",
      "with nothing, but I don’t think that they will abandon me without\n",
      "\n",
      "giving me something in return.’ ‘By God,’ said Anis al-Jalis, ‘they\n",
      "\n",
      "will be of no help at all to you.’ ‘I shall go to them at once,’ said Nur\n",
      "\n",
      "al-Din, ‘and knock on their doors. They may supply me with what I\n",
      "\n",
      "can use as trading capital, and I will then abandon pleasure and idle\n",
      "\n",
      "pastimes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up immediately and walked to the lane in which all ten of\n",
      "\n",
      "his companions lived. When he knocked on the \u0000rst door, a slave\n",
      "\n",
      "girl came out and asked him who he was. He said to her: ‘Tell your\n",
      "\n",
      "master that Nur al-Din ‘Ali is standing at the door and that he says\n",
      "\n",
      "to you: “Your slave kisses your hand and awaits your generosity.” ’\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl went in and told her master, but he shouted at her and told\n",
      "\n",
      "her to go back and tell Nur al-Din that he was not there, which she\n",
      "\n",
      "did. Nur al-Din turned away, saying to himself: ‘If this bastard\n",
      "\n",
      "pretends not to be there, perhaps one of the others may be more\n",
      "\n",
      "generous.’ So he went to the door of the second man and repeated\n",
      "\n",
      "what he had said before, but this man, too, pretended not to be in.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Nur al-Din recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "They have gone, those who when you were standing at their\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "showed himself or broke a loaf for him. So he recited:\n",

      "In his time of fortune man is like a tree;\n",

      "People surround it while it bears its fruit.\n",

      "\n",
      "good at all?’ ‘By God,’ he replied, ‘not one of them would show me\n",

      "his face and no one would acknowledge me.’ ‘Master,’ she then\n",
      "\n",
      "advised him, ‘sell the furniture and the household goods and wait\n",
      "\n",
      "for God’s providence, but dispose of them bit by bit.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So Nur al-Din started to sell what he had and he went on until he\n",

      "had disposed of everything in the house and had nothing left. Then\n",
      "\n",
      "he looked at Anis al-Jalis and said: ‘What shall we do now?’ ‘My\n",

      "advice, master, is that you should get up at once, take me down to\n",

      "the market and sell me. You know that your father bought me for\n",
      "\n",
      "ten thousand dinars, and it may be that God will open the way for\n",

      "you to get something like that price. Then later, if God decrees that\n",

      "we should meet, meet we shall.’ ‘By God, Anis al-Jalis,’ he said to\n",

      "\n",
      "Stop; give me a glance before you go,\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Does this good-for-nothing have anything left over for buying slave\n",

      "\n",
      "surrounded by merchants, calling for bids. ‘I think that Nur al-Din\n",

      "\n",
      "said. The auctioneer could not oppose him and replied: ‘Sir, let it be\n",

      "and gestured to al-Mu‘in. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘here is her owner just\n",

      "reconciled, in which case both of them would hate you, or a blow\n",

      "of his blood and the colour of ashes. When he saw the state he was\n",

      "in, he took a piece of matting and placed it round his neck, and\n",
      "\n",
      "taking two handfuls of esparto grass, he went to stand beneath the\n",

      "sultan’s palace, where he called out: ‘King of the age, I have been\n",

      "happened to you and who treated you like this, when the respect\n",
      "\n",
      "owed to me covers you as well.’ Al-Mu‘in replied: ‘You must know,\n",

      "\n",

      "about her owner. He told me that she belonged to Nur al-Din ‘Ali,\n",

      "the son of al-Fadl ibn Khaqan. You, master, had earlier given his\n",

      "\n",
      "This was the one whom he bought, but because he admired her, he\n",

      "was reluctant to see her go to you, and so he gave her to his son. On\n",
      "\n",
      "his father’s death, Nur al-Din sold all his properties, his orchards\n",

      "and his household goods until he became bankrupt. Then he took\n",
      "\n",
      "the girl to the market to sell her. He handed her over to the\n",

      "each other until her price reached four thousand dinars. I said to\n",
      "\n",
      "myself: “I will buy her for my master, the sultan, as it was he who\n",
      "\n",
      "paid the price for her originally.” So I said to Nur al-Din: “My son,\n",
      "\n",
      "take four thousand dinars from me as her price.” When he heard\n",
      "\n",
      "this, he looked at me and said: “You ill-omened old man, I shall sell\n",
      "\n",
      "her to Jews and Christians, but I will not sell her to you.” “I am not\n",
      "\n",
      "buying her for myself,” I said, “but for our master, the sultan, who is\n",

      "heard what he had to say, the vein of anger stood out between his\n",

      "glory be to Him who does not sleep!\n",
      "\n",
      "This garden was called the Garden of Pleasure and in it was a\n",

      "of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, who would come to the garden and the\n",
      "\n",
      "palace when he was feeling depressed, and sit there. The palace had\n",
      "\n",
      "eighty windows, with eighty hanging lamps, and in the middle there\n",
      "\n",
      "was a great candelabrum made of gold. When the caliph came in, he\n",
      "\n",
      "would tell the slave girls to open the windows. Then he would order\n",
      "\n",
      "the singing girls and his boon companion, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim, to\n",

      "sing, until his depression was relieved and his cares dispelled.\n",

      "In charge of the garden was a very old man, Shaikh Ibrahim by\n",

      "\n",
      "pleasure seekers there accompanied by prostitutes, and that made\n",
      "\n",
      "him furiously angry. He waited until one day he had found an\n",

      "\n",
      "to do whatever he wanted with anyone he found on the benches by\n",

      "the garden gate. On that particular day, he had gone out to do\n",
      "\n",
      "something and by the gate he found Nur al-Din and Anis al-Jalis\n",
      "\n",
      "covered by a single mantle. ‘Good, by God,’ he said to himself.\n",
      "\n",

      "be seen and was on the point of striking them when he thought to\n",

      "himself: ‘Ibrahim, how can you strike them when you know nothing\n",
      "\n",
      "about them? They may be strangers or wanderers brought here by\n",

      "\n",
      "and, sitting up, he took Ibrahim’s hand and kissed it. Ibrahim asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My son, where do you come from?’ Nur al-Din replied: ‘Sir, we are\n",
      "\n",
      "strangers,’ and his eyes brimmed with tears. Shaikh Ibrahim said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Know, my son, that the Prophet – may God bless him and give him\n",

      "peace! – enjoined us to treat strangers hospitably.’ Then he added:\n",

      "‘Why don’t you get up and go into the garden to enjoy yourselves\n",

      "and relax there?’ ‘Sir,’ asked Nur al-Din, ‘who owns this garden?’ In\n",

      "encourage them to stroll round the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Nur al-Din heard this, he thanked him, after which he and\n",
      "\n",
      "Anis al-Jalis got up and, with Ibrahim leading the way, they went\n",
      "\n",
      "further into the garden – and what a garden it was! Its gate was\n",
      "\n",
      "arched like a vaulted hall, covered with vines, whose grapes varied\n",
      "\n",
      "in colour from ruby red to ebony black. They walked beneath a\n",
      "\n",
      "trellis where fruits hung in pairs or singly. On the branches birds\n",
      "\n",
      "sang tunefully, with the nightingale repeating her melodies and the\n",

      "turtledove \u0000lling the garden with song, the blackbird warbling like a\n",
      "\n",
      "human singer, and the ringdove singing like one drunk with wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "All kinds of edible fruits were there. There were camphor apricots,\n",
      "\n",
      "almond apricots and the apricots of Khurasan. There were plums\n",

      "coloured like beautiful girls, cherries that keep the teeth from\n",

      "turning yellow, and \u0000gs of two colours, red and white. There were\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000owers like pearls and coral. The redness of the rose put to shame\n",
      "\n",
      "the cheeks of the beautiful women; the violets were like sulphur to\n",
      "\n",
      "which \u0000re has been put at night; and there was myrtle along with\n",
      "\n",
      "gilly\u0000owers, lavender and red anemones. The leaves were bedewed\n",
      "\n",
      "with the tears of the clouds; the mouths of the camomiles smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The narcissus looked at the rose with its Negro’s eyes; the citrons\n",

      "were like cups and the lemons like nuts of gold. The ground was\n",
      "\n",
      "strewn with \u0000owers of all kinds. Spring had come and its splendour\n",
      "\n",
      "added radiance to the garden. The streams murmured; the notes of\n",

      "‘For people drink after they have eaten.’ Ibrahim brought him water,\n",
      "\n",
      "pleasant, cool and sweet, but he said: ‘This is not the type of drink\n",

      "that I want.’ ‘Perhaps you would prefer wine?’ asked Ibrahim, and\n",

      "\n",
      "God bless him and give him peace! – cursed those who drink it as\n",
      "\n",
      "well as those who press its grapes, those who sell it and those who\n",
      "\n",
      "buy it.’ ‘Listen to a couple of words from me,’ said Nur al-Din, and\n",
      "\n",
      "when he was urged to go on, he said: ‘If this damned donkey is\n",

      "the donkey and stop some distance away. When you come across\n",
      "\n",
      "someone making purchases, call to him and say: “Take these two\n",

      "ready for the Commander of the Faithful. Go and take what you\n",
      "\n",
      "like, for there is more there than you can need.’ Nur al-Din went in\n",
      "\n",
      "and found utensils of gold, silver and crystal, studded with gems of\n",
      "\n",
      "all kinds. He took them out, set them in a row, and poured wine\n",
      "\n",
      "into jugs and bottles. He was pleased by what he saw to the point of\n",
      "\n",
      "astonishment. Shaikh Ibrahim brought fruits and scented \u0000owers,\n",
      "\n",
      "and then went and sat at some distance from the couple. They drank\n",
      "\n",
      "with enjoyment, and, as the wine took hold of them, their cheeks\n",
      "\n",
      "grew red, they exchanged amorous glances, and their hair hung\n",

      "down as their colour changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaikh Ibrahim said to himself: ‘Why am I sitting so far away?\n",

      "\u0000lled a second one, and setting it by a candle, she said: ‘There is still\n",

      "\n",
      "It was she who told me to do it.’ Nur al-Din laughed and they all sat\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Excellent, by God, Ja‘far,’ said the caliph. ‘Never in my life have\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard a voice as delightful as this.’ Ja‘far then asked whether his\n",
      "\n",
      "anger had left him. ‘Yes, it has gone,’ he replied, after which the two\n",
      "\n",
      "of them climbed down from the tree. The caliph then said to Ja‘far:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I want to go and sit with them and listen to the girl singing in front\n",

      "problem, they came across a \u0000sherman, who was casting his net\n",
      "\n",
      "beneath the palace windows. Some time earlier, the caliph had\n",
      "\n",
      "called to Ibrahim to ask him what the noises were that he could\n",

      "hear beneath the windows of his palace. On being told that these\n",

      "were the voices of \u0000shermen, he had told Ibrahim to go down and\n",

      "stop them \u0000shing there, and as a result, \u0000shermen had been ordered\n",
      "\n",
      "to keep away. That night, however, one of them, called Karim, had\n",
      "\n",
      "come and found the garden gate open. He had said to himself that\n",
      "\n",
      "somebody must have been careless and that it was time to take\n",
      "\n",
      "advantage of it. He had taken his net and cast it into the river, but\n",
      "\n",
      "then all of a sudden he saw the caliph standing beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The caliph had recognized him and addressed him by name. On\n",
      "\n",
      "hearing himself being addressed as ‘Karim’, the \u0000sherman had\n",
      "\n",
      "turned, and at the sight of the caliph, he began to tremble.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Commander of the Faithful,’ he said, ‘I have not done this out of\n",
      "\n",
      "disrespect for your orders, but poverty and the needs of my family\n",
      "\n",
      "have led me to do what you see me doing.’ ‘Try a cast in my name,’\n",
      "\n",
      "said the caliph, and the \u0000sherman came up joyfully, cast his net and\n",
      "\n",
      "waited until it had opened to its fullest extent and settled on the\n",
      "\n",
      "bottom, before drawing it in. It turned out to be \u0000lled with all kinds\n",
      "\n",
      "of \u0000sh, which pleased the caliph. He then told Karim to take o\u0000 his\n",

      "clothes, a smock with a hundred patches of rough wool, full of long-\n",
      "\n",
      "tailed lice, and on his head a turban that he had not unwound for\n",
      "\n",
      "three years and on to which he had sewn every rag that he could\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000nd. The caliph then stripped o\u0000 two robes of Alexandrian and\n",
      "\n",
      "Baalbaki silk, as well as an over-mantle and a mantle. He told Karim\n",
      "\n",
      "to take these and put them on, while he in turn put on Karim’s\n",
      "\n",
      "smock and turban, veiling the lower part of his face. ‘Now go about\n",
      "\n",
      "your business,’ he told Karim, who kissed his foot, thanked him and\n",
      "\n",
      "started to recite:\n",
      "\n",
      "You have granted favours, for which I proclaim my gratitude,\n",

      "Before the \u0000sherman had \u0000nished his poem, the lice started\n",
      "\n",
      "crawling over the caliph’s skin and he had to use both hands to pull\n",
      "\n",
      "them o\u0000 his neck and throw them away. ‘You wretched \u0000sherman,’\n",
      "\n",
      "he exclaimed, ‘there are swarms of lice in this smock!’ ‘They may\n",
      "\n",
      "annoy you just now, master,’ said Karim, ‘but after a week you\n",
      "\n",
      "won’t notice them or think about them.’ The caliph laughed and\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘Am I to go on wearing this smock?’ ‘I would like to say\n",
      "\n",
      "something,’ said Karim. ‘Say on,’ replied the caliph. ‘It has struck\n",
      "\n",
      "me, Commander of the Faithful,’ said Karim, ‘that if you want to\n",

      "learn how to \u0000sh so as to be master of a useful trade, this smock will\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "way.\n",

      "\n",
      "him, Ja‘far believed that he was Karim the \u0000sherman and was afraid\n",
      "\n",
      "for the man’s safety. ‘Karim,’ he said, ‘what has brought you here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Save yourself, for the caliph is in the garden tonight, and if he sees\n",
      "\n",
      "you, you will lose your life.’ On hearing this, the caliph laughed,\n",
      "\n",
      "and Ja‘far, recognizing him by his laugh, said: ‘Perhaps you are the\n",

      "al-Din to Ibrahim. ‘Who is there?’ asked Ibrahim. ‘It is I, Shaikh\n",

      "Ibrahim did that and the caliph, in his disguise as a \u0000sherman, came\n",

      "\n",
      "‘You’re right, lady,’ said Ibrahim, and he then asked the caliph:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why didn’t you bring these \u0000sh fried? Go o\u0000 at once, fry them and\n",
      "\n",
      "then fetch them back to us.’ ‘At your command,’ said the caliph. ‘I’ll\n",
      "\n",
      "fry them for you and then bring them back.’ ‘Get on with it,’ they\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Ja‘far,’ he called. ‘Yes, Commander of the Faithful,’ said the\n",
      "\n",
      "vizier, ‘is everything all right?’ ‘They have asked for the \u0000sh to be\n",
      "\n",
      "fried,’ replied the caliph. ‘Hand them over, Commander of the\n",
      "\n",
      "Faithful,’ said Ja‘far, ‘and I shall do the frying for them.’ ‘By the\n",

      "\n",
      "then went to the gardener’s hut, and after rummaging through it, he\n",
      "\n",
      "found everything that he needed, including salt, sa\u0000ron, thyme and\n",
      "\n",
      "other seasonings. He went to the brazier, set the frying pan on it and\n",
      "\n",
      "fried the \u0000sh nicely. When they were ready, he put them on a\n",
      "\n",
      "banana leaf, and after collecting some windfalls and some lemons\n",

      "\n",
      "the bitterness of poverty from your heart, but take what matches my\n",

      "\n",
      "that if Nur al-Din had come to any harm, the caliph would execute\n",

      "walked with the others until they came to the chapel, where prayers\n",

      "were said over the dead man. Then all the merchants walked in\n",

      "front of the bier to the burial ground, with Ghanim modestly\n",

      "buried and the Quran reciters sat to recite verses over the grave. The\n",
      "\n",
      "merchants took their seats, as did Ghanim, but he was overcome by\n",
      "\n",
      "shyness, telling himself: ‘I cannot leave them, and will have to go\n",
      "\n",
      "back with them.’ They sat listening to the Quran until evening,\n",

      "when supper and sweetmeats were produced for them. The guests\n",
      "\n",
      "ate their \u0000ll, washed their hands and then sat down again in their\n",
      "\n",
      "places. Ghanim, however, was preoccupied by thoughts of his house\n",

      "and his goods. He was afraid of thieves and said to himself: ‘I am a\n",

      "from home, thieves will steal my money and my goods.’\n",

      "left the company, excusing himself to them on the grounds of the\n",

      "call of nature. He started to walk, following the waymarks until he\n",
      "\n",
      "came to the city gate, but as it was now midnight, he found the gate\n",
      "\n",
      "shut. He could see nobody coming or going and the only sounds to\n",

      "be heard were the barking of dogs and the howls of jackals. He\n",

      "turned back, exclaiming: ‘There is no might and no power except\n",

      "with God! I was afraid for my wealth, which is why I came here, but\n",
      "\n",
      "now that I have found the gate shut, it is my life for which I fear.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He went back in search of a place in which to sleep until morning\n",

      "and found a burial plot, surrounded by four walls, with a palm tree\n",
      "\n",
      "in the middle of it and a stone gateway, whose door stood open.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went in with the intention of sleeping there, but before he\n",
      "\n",
      "could fall asleep, he started to tremble, feeling the desolation of his\n",

      "situation among the tombs. So he got to his feet, went through the\n",
      "\n",
      "door and looked out. There in the distance, in the direction of the\n",

      "\n",
      "that the light was on the track leading to the burial plot where he\n",

      "was. Fearing for his life, he quickly shut the gate and climbed to the\n",

      "\n",
      "Little by little the light came nearer until, when it was close by,\n",

      "a chest and one carrying a lantern and an axe. When they got near\n",
      "\n",
      "the tomb, one of the two carrying the chest said: ‘What’s the matter\n",

      "\n",
      "you two are,’ said the third man, whose name was Bukhait and who\n",
      "\n",
      "was carrying the axe and lantern. ‘Don’t you know that the owners\n",
      "\n",
      "of gardens are in the habit of coming out of Baghdad to look after\n",
      "\n",
      "their property here, and if they are still here in the evening, they\n",
      "\n",
      "come in and shut the door, for fear of being caught, roasted and\n",

      "cleverness and all this knowledge of yours. There is no might and no\n",

      "power except in the Exalted and Omnipotent God. What can I do\n",
      "\n",
      "now to save myself from these slaves?’ The two who were carrying\n",

      "his fat will be wasted.’ Bukhait replied: ‘Because of my silliness, I’m\n",
      "\n",
      "afraid of something I’ve thought of, and I think the best thing to do\n",
      "\n",
      "is to throw in the chest behind the door, for it holds our treasure.’\n",

      "\n",
      "around, she saw that she was in a handsome house, spread with\n",

      "\n",
      "she said, ‘bring us something to eat.’ ‘Willingly,’ he replied, and he\n",
      "\n",
      "then went down to the market, where he bought a roast lamb and a\n",

      "\n",
      "he \u0000lled her glass and gave her wine to drink, she did the same for\n",

      "him. They were playing, laughing and reciting poetry as their gaiety\n",
      "\n",
      "increased, and each became more deeply in love with the other –\n",

      "needed – vegetables, meat, wine, and so on. He took these to the\n",
      "\n",
      "house, and the two of them sat down to eat until they had had\n",
      "\n",
      "enough. Then he produced the wine and they drank and played with\n",

      "each other until their cheeks grew red and their eyes darkened.\n",

      "\n",
      "he said: ‘Lady, won’t you let me do what I asked you?’ ‘By God,’ she\n",
      "\n",
      "said, ‘that cannot be, as there is a hard word written on the\n",

      "became more distant, so the ardour of his love increased, and he\n",
      "\n",
      "recited:\n",

      "Do not enquire what happened then.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Whether a foe gives it away or keeps it hidden.\n",
      "\n",
      "His love now increased and the \u0000res of passion spread through\n",

      "have me,’ but they continued to drink together as lovers. Ghanim\n",
      "\n",
      "was drowning in a sea of passion, while the girl became ever stricter\n",
      "\n",
      "in her modesty, until night brought its darkness and lowered the\n",
      "\n",
      "skirts of sleep on them. Ghanim got up to light the lamps and the\n",
      "\n",
      "candles, and he set the room and the table to rights. He then took\n",
      "\n",
      "her feet and kissed them, and, \u0000nding them like fresh butter, he\n",
      "\n",
      "rubbed his face on them. ‘Have pity, lady,’ he said, ‘on one enslaved\n",
      "\n",
      "by your love and slain by your eyes. But for you, my heart would\n",
      "\n",
      "have stayed whole.’ He then wept a little, and she said: ‘My master\n",
      "\n",
      "and light of my eyes, by God I love you and trust you, but I know\n",
      "\n",
      "that you cannot have me.’ ‘What is the hindrance?’ he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tonight,’ she said, ‘I shall tell you my story so that you may accept\n",
      "\n",
      "my excuse.’ Then she threw herself on him and kissed him, winding\n",
      "\n",
      "her arms around his neck as she comforted him and gave him\n",
      "\n",
      "promises of union. They continued to play and laugh until love for\n",
      "\n",
      "the other was \u0000rmly entrenched in each of their hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things went on like this for a whole month. Every night they\n",
      "\n",
      "slept on the same bed, but every time that he asked her for union\n",
      "\n",
      "she rejected him, in spite of the fact that they loved each other and\n",
      "\n",
      "could scarcely endure to be kept apart. It happened then one night\n",
      "\n",
      "that, when the two of them were drunk and were lying there,\n",
      "\n",
      "Ghanim reached out and caressed her body. His hand went to her\n",

      "belly and down to her navel. This roused her and she sat up,\n",
      "\n",
      "inspected her drawers, but when she found that they were still\n",
      "\n",
      "fastened, she went to sleep again. He stroked her with his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "which slipped down to the waistband of her drawers. When he\n",
      "\n",
      "pulled at it, she woke up again and sat up, with Ghanim sitting by\n",
      "\n",
      "her side. ‘What do you want?’ she asked. ‘To sleep with you,’ he\n",
      "\n",
      "replied, ‘and that we should be frank with one another.’ ‘The time\n",
      "\n",

      "may know my standing, discover my secret and see plainly my\n",

      "excuse.’ ‘Yes,’ he said, and at that she tore open the bottom of her\n",
      "\n",
      "shift and put her hand on the waistband of her drawers. ‘Master,’\n",
      "\n",
      "she said, ‘read what is written on the border of this waistband.’\n",

      "of the Prophet.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When he read this, he removed his hand and said: ‘Tell me your\n",

      "and the caliph saw my qualities and the beauty and grace with\n",

      "which God had endowed me, he fell deeply in love with me. He took\n",
      "\n",
      "me and installed me in an apartment of my own, giving me ten slave\n",
      "\n",
      "girls to serve me, and he then presented me with the jewellery\n",

      "which you see that I have with me. One day when he had left on a\n",

      "head over heels, conscious only of being in some other world. When\n",

      "the gatekeepers. Then she sent me o\u0000 with them on the night that\n",

      "\n",
      "Byzantium has asked you for protection and has sent you a present,\n",

      "which you have accepted; the second reason is that no enemy dares\n",

      "When ‘Umar heard what his vizier had to say, it pleased him and\n",

      "Sharkan to be brought to him and he, on his arrival, kissed the\n",

      "to be ready in three days. Obediently, they kissed the ground in\n",

      "see the stream, with birds singing gaily, gazelles roaming freely and\n",

      "wild beasts pasturing. Pleasure was expressed in the varied songs of\n",

      "If you have strength enough to wrestle with me, then come here so\n",

      "that I may set about you and put your head between your legs.’ The\n",

      "\n",
      "to the old woman and said: ‘By the truth of the Messiah, do you\n",

      "really mean to wrestle with me, Dhat al-Dawahi, or are you joking?’\n",

      "with me, Dhat al-Dawahi, or are you joking?’ ‘I will certainly\n",

      "strength.’ At this, the old woman became furiously angry and all the\n",

      "hairs on her body stood out like the prickles of a hedgehog. She\n",
      "\n",
      "jumped forward and, as the girl rose to meet her, the old woman\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘By the truth of the Messiah, harlot, I shall only wrestle against\n",
      "\n",
      "you naked.’ She took a silk kerchief, unloosed her drawers and then,\n",
      "\n",
      "grasping her clothes with both hands, she stripped them from her\n",
      "\n",
      "body. She then picked up the kerchief and tied it round her waist\n",
      "\n",
      "until she looked like a hairless ‘ifrit or a spotted snake. Turning to\n",
      "\n",
      "the girl, she told her to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharkan was watching all this and laughing as he looked at the\n",
      "\n",
      "misshapen form of the old woman. When her opponent had\n",
      "\n",
      "stripped, the girl in a leisurely way took a Yemeni towel and twisted\n",
      "\n",
      "it twice round herself. She tucked up her harem trousers, revealing\n",
      "\n",
      "two thighs of marble, surmounted by a crystal sand hill, soft and\n",
      "\n",
      "plump, a belly from whose folds wafted the scent of musk, looking\n",
      "\n",
      "as though it was covered with anemones, and a chest with two\n",
      "\n",
      "breasts like a pair of luxuriant pomegranates. The old woman leaned\n",
      "\n",
      "towards her and the two of them grappled, while Sharkan gazed up\n",
      "\n",
      "to heaven and prayed to God that the girl would get the better of\n",
      "\n",
      "the old woman. The girl, meanwhile, got under her, put her left\n",
      "\n",
      "hand on her girdle, with her right around the old woman’s\n",

      "windpipe, and then lifted her up with both hands. The old woman\n",
      "\n",
      "slipped out of her grip, but in trying to get free, she fell over with\n",
      "\n",
      "her legs in the air, showing her pubic hair in the moonlight. She\n",
      "\n",
      "farted twice, the \u0000rst fart scattering the dust on the ground and the\n",
      "\n",
      "second raising a stench to heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharkan laughed so much that he fell over, but then he got up\n",
      "\n",
      "and drew his sword, looking to right and left. He saw nobody except\n",
      "\n",
      "the old woman lying on her back and he said to himself: ‘Whoever\n",
      "called you Dhat al-Dawahi* did not lie; you should have known the\n",
      "\n",
      "girl’s strength by what she did to the others.’ He then went nearer to\n",
      "\n",
      "the two opponents to listen to what they were saying. The girl came\n",
      "\n",
      "up and threw an elegant silk wrap over the old woman, clothed her,\n",
      "\n",
      "and excused herself for what she had done, saying: ‘I only meant to\n",
      "\n",
      "throw you, lady; nothing that happened to you was intended, but\n",
      "\n",
      "you slipped out of my hands. God be thanked that you are unhurt.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman made no reply, but got up and walked o\u0000\n",
      "\n",
      "shamefacedly until she was out of sight. The others were still tied up\n",
      "\n",
      "on the ground and the girl was left standing alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Every piece of good fortune has its cause,’ said Sharkan to\n",
      "\n",
      "himself. ‘It was thanks to my good luck that I fell asleep and that my\n",
      "\n",
      "horse brought me here, and it may be that this girl and her\n",
      "\n",
      "companions will be my booty.’ He went to his horse, mounted it and\n",
      "\n",
      "touched its sides with his spurs. It shot o\u0000 with him like an arrow\n",
      "\n",
      "from a bow and, after unsheathing his sword, he shouted: ‘Allahu\n",
      "\n",
      "akbar!’ When the girl saw him, she got up to stand on the bank of\n",
      "\n",
      "the stream, which was six cubits wide, and she then jumped across\n",
      "\n",
      "and took up her stance on the other side. She called in a loud voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who are you, fellow? You have interrupted our pleasures and have\n",
      "\n",
      "brandished your sword as though you were charging against an\n",
      "\n",
      "army. Where do you come from and where are you going? Don’t try\n",
      "\n",
      "to lie, for lying is one of the qualities of base men, but tell the truth,\n",
      "\n",
      "for this will do you more good. No doubt you have lost your way in\n",
      "\n",
      "the night and that is why you have come to a place where the most\n",
      "\n",
      "you can hope for is to escape unscathed. You are now in a meadow\n",
      "\n",
      "where, were I to give a single cry, four thousand knights would\n",
      "\n",
      "come to my aid. Tell me what you want. If you need to be directed\n",
      "\n",
      "to your road, I shall guide you and if you want help, I shall help\n",

      "you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sharkan heard what she said, he replied: ‘I am a Muslim\n",

      "stranger and I came here alone tonight looking for plunder. I have\n",
      "\n",
      "found no better booty in this moonlight than these ten girls and I\n",

      "shall take them and bring them to my companions.’ ‘You have found\n",
      "\n",
      "no booty at all,’ the other replied, ‘for, by God, these girls are no\n",

      "you and I can wrestle together, and if you throw me, then put me on\n",
      "\n",
      "your horse and take us all, but if I throw you, you will be at my\n",
      "\n",
      "command. Swear to that, as I am afraid of treachery on your part,\n",
      "\n",
      "for, as it is noted, treachery comes naturally, and to trust everyone\n",
      "\n",
      "is a sign of weakness. If you do swear, then I shall cross over the\n",

      "Sharkan was eager to capture her, and said to himself: ‘She\n",

      "\n",
      "then said: ‘Swear by the One Who has set the breath of life in bodies\n",

      "getting tired. I must untie them, as it may be that the next bout with\n",

      "released them, she said to them in Greek: ‘Go o\u0000 to a safe place, so\n",

      "that this Muslim may stop coveting you.’\n",

      "were looking back at the wrestlers. The two approached each other\n",
      "\n",
      "and Sharkan set his belly against that of the girl. When she felt this,\n",
      "\n",
      "she lifted him up with her hands faster than a lightning \u0000ash and\n",
      "\n",
      "threw him to the ground. He fell on his back and she told him: ‘Get\n",

      "\n",
      "generous to you because of your Prophet, as he did not allow the\n",
      "\n",
      "killing of women, and this second time is because of your own\n",

      "you to send him to me and to tell him about me. There are as many\n",

      "\n",
      "mentioned. By God, it was not by your strength that you threw me,\n",
      "\n",
      "but by the seduction of your buttocks. We Iraqis are fond of large\n",
      "\n",
      "thighs, and this robbed me of my wits and of my sight. But if you\n",
      "\n",
      "wish, you can wrestle with me again when I have my wits about me,\n",

      "I’m sure that this bout will be enough.’ So saying, she leaned\n",
      "\n",
      "forward, challenging him to wrestle, and he did the same, beginning\n",
      "\n",
      "to exert himself and taking care not to weaken. They grappled for a\n",

      "before. ‘You are taking care, Muslim,’ she said. ‘Yes,’ he agreed, ‘for\n",

      "perplexity, regretting what he had done, until dawn broke and day\n",
      "\n",
      "appeared. Sighing in distress over his actions and drowning in a sea\n",
      "\n",
      "of care, he recited these lines:\n",

      "moment and came back with a Damascene lute, a Persian harp, a\n",
      "\n",
      "Tartar \u0000ute and an Egyptian zither. She took the lute, tuned it,\n",
      "\n",
      "tightening its strings, and then sang to it in a melodious voice –\n",
      "\n",
      "softer than the zephyr and sweeter than the water of Paradise –\n",
      "\n",
      "from a wounded heart:\n",

      "with pleasure. Then it was the turn of their mistress to sing herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Muslim,’ she asked, ‘can you understand what I am saying?’ ‘No,’ he\n",

      "answered, ‘but I take pleasure in the beauty of your \u0000ngers.’ She\n",
      "\n",
      "laughed and said: ‘If I sing to you in Arabic, what will you do?’ ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "would go out of my mind,’ he replied. So she took an instrument\n",
      "\n",
      "and sang in a di\u0000erent tempo:\n",
      "\n",
      "How bitter is the taste of parting; can it be endured?\n",
      "\n",
      "I faced three things: aversion, distance and abandonment.\n",

      "that he had indeed lost his senses and was lying at full length among\n",

      "the maids. After a time, he recovered and, remembering the song,\n",

      "\u0000own and night had lowered its wing. The lady then got up and\n",
      "\n",
      "when Sharkan asked about her, her maids told him that she had\n",
      "\n",
      "gone to her bedroom. ‘May God guard and protect her,’ he said. In\n",
      "\n",
      "the morning, a maid came to him and said: ‘My mistress invites you\n",
      "\n",
      "to go to her.’ He got up and followed her, and when he came near\n",
      "\n",
      "the place, the other maids accompanied him in a procession with\n",
      "\n",
      "tambourines and \u0000utes until they came to a large door of ivory,\n",

      "studded with pearls and other gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they entered, Sharkan found a large apartment, at the top\n",

      "\n",
      "Within it were open windows looking out over trees and streams,\n",
      "\n",
      "together with lifelike images into which the wind could enter,\n",
      "\n",
      "setting in motion machinery inside them which gave the impression\n",
      "\n",
      "that they were speaking. The lady was seated watching them, and\n",
      "\n",
      "when she saw Sharkan, she got to her feet, took his hand and seated\n",
      "\n",
      "him beside her. She asked what kind of a night he had passed, and\n",
      "\n",
      "after he had invoked blessings on her, they sat talking. ‘Do you\n",
      "\n",
      "know anything relating to lovers and the slaves of love?’ she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, I know some poetry,’ he replied. ‘Let me hear it,’ she told him,\n",
      "\n",
      "and he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Health and delight, untainted by disease,\n",
      "\n",
      "To ‘Azza – how much of my honour is in her hands!\n",
      "\n",
      "By God, whenever I came near, she sternly kept away,\n",
      "\n",
      "And when I gave her much, she gave me little.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was between us is now at an end,\n",
      "\n",
      "And in my love for ‘Azza I am like a man\n",
      "\n",
      "Who hopes a dwindling cloud will shade his midday sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she heard this, the lady said: ‘Kuthaiyir was a chaste man\n",
      "\n",
      "of clear eloquence, and how well he described ‘Azza in the lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Were ‘Azza to dispute on the point of beauty with the morning\n",
      "\n",
      "sun\n",
      "\n",
      "Before a judge, he would rule in her favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women have slandered her to men,\n",
      "\n",
      "But may God set their cheeks beneath her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Azza is said to have been extremely beautiful,’ the lady added, and\n",
      "\n",
      "she went on to ask Sharkan to recite some lines by Jamil Buthaina,\n",
      "\n",
      "if he knew any. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I know his poetry better than\n",
      "\n",
      "anyone.’ Then he recited Jamil’s lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "They say: ‘Fight in the Holy War, Jamil; go on a raid.’\n",
      "\n",
      "But what war do I want to wage except the war of women?\n",
      "\n",
      "In every talk of theirs is joy,\n",
      "\n",
      "And all their victims die a martyr’s death.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I tell her my love is killing me,\n",
      "\n",
      "She answers: ‘Stand \u0000rm and it will increase.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Return some of my wits,’ I tell her, ‘so I may\n",
      "\n",
      "Live amongst people.’ She says: ‘Far be it from you!’\n",
      "\n",
      "You want to kill me and none other, while I see\n",
      "\n",
      "No other goal to aim at except you.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well done, prince,’ said the lady, ‘and this was well spoken by\n",
      "\n",
      "Jamil. But what did Buthaina want with Jamil to make him produce\n",
      "\n",
      "the half line “You want to kill me and none other”?’ ‘Lady,’ said\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharkan, ‘she wanted what you want with me, and even that will\n",
      "\n",
      "not content you.’ She laughed at his words and they went on\n",
      "\n",
      "drinking until the day ended with the coming of the darkness of\n",
      "\n",
      "night. She then got up and went to her bedroom, where she slept,\n",
      "\n",
      "while Sharkan slept in his own place. When he awoke, the maids\n",
      "\n",
      "came to him as usual, with their tambourines and musical\n",
      "\n",
      "instruments. They kissed the ground before him and said: ‘In the\n",
      "\n",
      "Name of God, please answer our lady’s summons to come to her.’ He\n",
      "\n",
      "got up and walked between them as they beat their tambourines and\n",
      "\n",
      "played their instruments until, on leaving the \u0000rst apartment, he\n",
      "\n",
      "entered another, larger one, \u0000lled with statues and pictures of birds\n",
      "\n",
      "and beasts, that surpassed all description. Struck with wonder at the\n",
      "\n",
      "works of art that he saw there, he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Has the watcher plucked fruits of necklaces –\n",
      "\n",
      "Pearls set in gold from around throats,\n",
      "\n",
      "Gleaming eyes made from ingots of silver,\n",
      "\n",
      "And rosy cheeks in faces of topaz?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is as though the colour of the violet\n",
      "\n",
      "Matches the blue of eyes, daubed with antimony.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the sight of Sharkan, the lady got up, took him by the hand\n",
      "\n",
      "and sat him beside her. ‘Prince,’ she asked, ‘are you any good at\n",
      "\n",
      "chess?’ ‘Yes, I am,’ he replied, ‘but don’t be as the poet said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Passion folds and unfolds me as I speak;\n",
      "\n",
      "A draught of love’s saliva slakes my thirst.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came to play chess with her, and she played\n",
      "\n",
      "With both the white and black, not pleasing me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as though the king was next to the rook,\n",
      "\n",
      "While looking for a game with the two queens.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I try to establish what her glances mean,\n",
      "\n",
      "Their coquetry, I tell you, destroys me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She then brought out a chess set for him and played with him,\n",
      "\n",
      "but every time that he was about to study her moves, he was\n",
      "\n",
      "distracted by her face, and put his knight where the bishop should\n",
      "\n",
      "have gone, and vice versa. She laughed and said: ‘If this is how you\n",
      "\n",
      "play, you know nothing.’ ‘This is the \u0000rst game,’ he replied, ‘so don’t\n",
      "\n",
      "count it.’ When she had beaten him, he set out the pieces and\n",
      "\n",
      "played again, but she beat him a second time and then a third, a\n",
      "\n",
      "fourth and a \u0000fth. Turning to him, she said: ‘You are beaten at every\n",
      "\n",
      "turn.’ ‘My lady,’ he replied, ‘how can anyone who plays with\n",
      "\n",
      "someone like you fail to be beaten?’ She then ordered food to be\n",
      "\n",
      "brought, and after they had both eaten and washed their hands,\n",
      "\n",
      "wine was produced and they drank. Taking a zither, she touched it\n",
      "\n",
      "skilfully and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Time is both wrapped away and then spread out,\n",
      "\n",
      "Now an extended line and now a cone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink to its beauty if you can be sure\n",
      "\n",
      "That you will not leave or abandon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went on like this until night fell, and this second day was\n",
      "\n",
      "better than the \u0000rst. When night came, the lady went to her\n",
      "\n",
      "bedroom, leaving only the maids with Sharkan, who threw himself\n",
      "\n",
      "on the ground and slept until morning. The maids then came to him\n",
      "\n",
      "as usual, with their tambourines and musical instruments. When he\n",
      "\n",
      "saw them, he got up and they walked with him to meet the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "She got up when she saw him, took him by the hand and set him\n",
      "\n",
      "down by her side. She asked him what kind of night he had spent,\n",
      "\n",
      "and in return he wished her long life. She then took the lute and\n",
      "\n",
      "recited the lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not leave or part from me,\n",
      "\n",
      "For parting’s taste is bitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sun sets, it is the pain\n",
      "\n",
      "Of parting that has made it pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were occupied like this, there was a sudden\n",
      "\n",
      "commotion, with men crowding in and knights with drawn swords\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000ashing in their hands, shouting in Greek: ‘You have fallen into our\n",

      "hands, Sharkan; be sure that we shall kill you.’ When Sharkan heard\n",
      "\n",
      "this, he said to himself: ‘This girl has played a trick on me and has\n",
      "\n",
      "kept me here until her men could come. These are the riders with\n",
      "\n",
      "whom she threatened me, but it was I who brought the danger on\n",
      "\n",
      "myself.’ He turned to reproach her but found that she had turned\n",
      "\n",
      "pale, and she then leapt to her feet, saying: ‘Who are you?’ The\n",
      "\n",
      "leader of the knights replied: ‘Noble princess, pearl without equal,\n",
      "\n",
      "do you know who this man is who is with you?’ ‘No,’ she replied,\n",

      "\n",

      "Sharkan mounted, together with his hundred riders, and when\n",

      "the whole force had come to the battle\u0000eld, they found the Franks\n",
      "\n",
      "drawn up and ready. Sharkan said to his men: ‘Our foes intend to\n",

      "\u0000ght as they did yesterday, so prepare to charge them.’ Then a\n",

      "Before he had \u0000nished speaking, out rode a Frankish rider, armed\n",
      "\n",
      "from head to foot, wearing a golden surcoat and mounted on a grey\n",

      "horse, and with no hair on his face. He rode out and halted in the\n",

      "middle of the battle\u0000eld, after which the two began to exchange\n",

      "cuts and thrusts, but it was not long before the Frank unhorsed the\n",

      "\n",
      "and then charged each other and fought for a short time. Then the\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank bore down on his opponent and tricked him by striking him\n",
      "\n",
      "with the butt of his spear, so unhorsing him and capturing him. The\n",
      "\n",
      "Muslims continued to come out one by one and the Franks went on\n",
      "\n",
      "capturing them, until the day waned and night darkened, by which\n",

      "\n",
      "When Sharkan saw this, he found it hard to bear, and collecting\n",

      "about to go out to the battle\u0000eld when more than half the Franks\n",
      "\n",
      "dismounted before one of their riders and walked in front of him\n",
      "\n",
      "until they came to the middle of the ground. Sharkan looked at this\n",
      "\n",
      "man and saw that he was the Frankish commander. He wore a robe\n",
      "\n",
      "of blue satin, over which was a close-meshed mail coat. His face was\n",
      "\n",
      "like the full moon when it rises; in his hand was an Indian sword\n",
      "\n",
      "and he was mounted on a black horse with a blaze the size of a\n",
      "\n",
      "dirham on its face. His own face was hairless.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rider spurred his horse until he reached the centre of the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000eld and then, pointing at the Muslims, he said in \u0000uent Arabic:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sharkan, son of ‘Umar ibn al-Nu‘man, you who have taken\n",
      "\n",
      "fortresses and laid waste lands, I challenge you to \u0000ght one who\n",
      "\n",
      "shares the \u0000eld with you. You are the leader of your people and I\n",
      "\n",
      "am the leader of mine. Let whichever one of us overcomes the other\n",
      "\n",
      "command the obedience of the other’s men.’ Before he had \u0000nished\n",
      "\n",
      "speaking, Sharkan came out, his heart \u0000lled with rage. He spurred\n",
      "\n",
      "on his horse until he was close to the Frank and he then closed with\n",
      "\n",
      "him like an angry lion. The Frank met him with skill and power and\n",
      "\n",
      "struck him with a true horseman’s blow. The two of them then\n",
      "\n",
      "started to cut and thrust, and kept on charging and retreating,\n",
      "\n",
      "receiving and returning blows, like two mountains clashing or the\n",
      "\n",
      "collision of two oceans. They continued to \u0000ght until day was done\n",
      "\n",
      "and night fell. They then withdrew from each other, each returning\n",
      "\n",
      "to his own people.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Sharkan had rejoined his companions, he said to them: ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "have never before seen a rider like this. He has one particular trick\n",
      "\n",
      "which I have never seen anyone else use. When his opponent leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "himself open, rather than deal a fatal blow, he reverses his spear\n",
      "\n",
      "and strikes with the butt. I don’t know what the outcome of our duel\n",
      "\n",
      "will be, but I wish that we had people like him and his men in our\n",
      "\n",
      "own army.’ Sharkan then spent the night there, and in the morning\n",
      "\n",
      "the Frank came out again to meet him, stopping in the middle of the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000eld. Sharkan advanced against him and they started to \u0000ght. The\n",
      "\n",
      "duel was prolonged and the necks of the spectators craned towards\n",
      "\n",
      "the \u0000ghters, who continued to \u0000ght, struggle and thrust with their\n",
      "\n",
      "spears until the day was over and it had grown dark. They then\n",
      "\n",
      "parted and each returned to his own side, to whom they started to\n",
      "\n",
      "tell of their experiences in the duel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Frank told his companions that the result would be decided\n",
      "\n",
      "next day. After a night’s rest, in the morning the two rode out and\n",
      "\n",
      "charged against one another. They continued to \u0000ght until midday,\n",
      "\n",
      "but then the Frank played a trick. He spurred on his horse, but then\n",
      "\n",
      "pulled it up with the reins so that it stumbled, throwing o\u0000 its rider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharkan pounced on him and was about to strike him with his\n",
      "\n",
      "sword, fearing to prolong the a\u0000air, but the Frank shouted at him:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sharkan, this is not knightly behaviour, but the deed of a man who\n",
      "\n",
      "has been overcome by women.’ When Sharkan heard that, he looked\n",
      "\n",
      "up, stared at his opponent, and found that this was none other than\n",
      "\n",
      "Princess Abriza, whom he had earlier met in the convent. When he\n",
      "\n",
      "recognized her, he threw away his sword, kissed the ground before\n",
      "\n",
      "her and said: ‘What led you to do this?’ ‘I wanted to test you on the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000eld,’ she answered, ‘and to see how you could stand up to blows\n",
      "\n",
      "given in battle. All my companions are virgin girls. They have\n",
      "\n",
      "overcome your riders on the battle\u0000eld and had my horse not\n",

      "stumbled and brought me down, you would have seen how strongly\n",
      "\n",
      "I can \u0000ght.’ Sharkan smiled at this and said: ‘Praise be to God for\n",
      "\n",
      "our safety and for my meeting with you, queen of the age!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Abriza then called to her girls and told them to dismount, after\n",
      "\n",
      "releasing the twenty Muslims whom they had captured from\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharkan’s band. The girls obeyed her orders and then kissed the\n",

      "ground before Sharkan and Abriza, as Sharkan told them: ‘People\n",
      "\n",
      "like you should be treasured by kings to help in times of peril.’ He\n",
      "\n",
      "then gestured to his men, telling them to greet the princess. They all\n",
      "\n",
      "dismounted and kissed the ground before her, for they had realized\n",
      "\n",
      "what the position was. Then all two hundred of them mounted and\n",
      "\n",
      "rode day and night for six days, by which time they were near\n",
      "\n",
      "Muslim territory. Sharkan told Abriza and her girls to remove their\n",
      "\n",
      "Frankish clothes…\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",
      "\n",
      "been allowed to say. Then, when it was the \u0000fty-\u0000rst night, she\n",
      "\n",
      "continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that Sharkan told Abriza and her\n",
      "\n",
      "girls to remove their Frankish clothes and to dress as Rumi girls,\n",
      "\n",
      "which they did. He then sent a number of his companions to\n",
      "\n",
      "Baghdad to tell his father of his arrival and that with him was\n",
      "\n",
      "Princess Abriza, daughter of Hardub, king of Rum, so that ‘Umar\n",
      "\n",
      "might send someone to meet her. The rest immediately dismounted\n",
      "\n",
      "where they were, as did Sharkan, and there they passed the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Almighty God sent morning, Sharkan and his companions,\n",
      "\n",
      "together with Abriza and hers, rode out and were approaching the\n",
      "\n",
      "city when they were met by Dandan who had come out with a\n",
      "\n",
      "thousand riders to meet the two of them on the instructions of King\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Umar.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the vizier and his men had come close, they went up to\n",

      "\n",
      "escort for them as they rode into the city and up to the palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharkan then went into his father’s presence, and his father rose to\n",
      "\n",
      "embrace him, asking him what news he had brought. Sharkan told\n",
      "\n",
      "him what Princess Abriza had said, as well as of his encounter with\n",
      "\n",
      "her and of how she had come to leave her kingdom and part from\n",
      "\n",
      "her father. He explained: ‘She chose to leave with us in order to stay\n",
      "\n",
      "here. The emperor of Constantinople wanted to trick us out of\n",
      "\n",
      "revenge for his daughter Sophia, as the king of Rum told him what\n",
      "\n",
      "had happened to her, explaining why she had been given to you,\n",
      "\n",
      "and assuring him that he had not known that she was his daughter,\n",
      "\n",
      "while, had he known that, he would not have passed her to you but\n",
      "\n",
      "would have returned Sophia to him.’ Sharkan then added: ‘We only\n",
      "\n",
      "escaped from this adventure because of this girl Abriza, and I have\n",
      "\n",
      "never seen anyone braver than her.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He then began to tell his father what she had done with him,\n",
      "\n",
      "from beginning to end, including their wrestling match and their\n",
      "\n",
      "duel. When his father heard all this, Abriza rose in his estimation\n",
      "\n",
      "and he began to wish to see her. He asked that she come to be\n",
      "\n",
      "questioned, and at that, Sharkan went to her to tell her of the\n",
      "\n",
      "summons. ‘To hear is to obey,’ she said, and Sharkan brought her\n",
      "\n",
      "before the king. ‘Umar, for his part, was seated on his throne and he\n",
      "\n",
      "sent away his courtiers, so that only the eunuchs were present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abriza entered, kissed the ground before him and addressed him in\n",
      "\n",
      "fair words. He was astonished at her eloquence and, after thanking\n",
      "\n",
      "her for what she had done for his son Sharkan, he told her to sit.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down and uncovered her face, at the sight of which the\n",
      "\n",
      "king’s wits \u0000ew from him. He made her come nearer and promised\n",
      "\n",
      "her a palace of her own for herself and her girls, assigning\n",
      "\n",
      "allowances to each of them. He then began to ask her about the\n",
      "\n",
      "three gems that were mentioned earlier. ‘I have them with me, king\n",
      "\n",
      "of the age,’ she said, and she then went to her quarters, opened her\n",
      "\n",
      "baggage and brought out a case from which she took a golden box.\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened this and took from it the three gems which she kissed\n",
      "\n",
      "before giving them to the king. She then left, taking his heart with\n",
      "\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "After she had gone, the king sent for Sharkan, and when he had\n",
      "\n",
      "come, the king gave him one of the three gems. Sharkan asked\n",
      "\n",
      "about the other two and the king said: ‘I will give one to your\n",
      "\n",
      "brother, Dau’ al-Makan, and the other to Nuzhat al-Zaman, your\n",
      "\n",
      "sister.’ Sharkan knew about his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, but when he\n",
      "\n",
      "heard that he had a brother called Dau’ al-Makan, he turned to his\n",
      "\n",
      "father and asked: ‘Your majesty, do you have another son apart from\n",
      "\n",
      "me?’ ‘Yes,’ replied the king, ‘and he is now six years old.’ He then\n",
      "\n",
      "told Sharkan that the child’s name was Dau’ al-Makan, his sister\n",
      "\n",
      "being Nuzhat al-Zaman, and that they were twins. Sharkan found\n",
      "\n",
      "this hard to bear, but he concealed his secret feelings and said to his\n",
      "\n",
      "father: ‘God bless you.’ Then he threw away the gem he was holding\n",
      "\n",
      "and shook the dust from his clothes. ‘Why do I see this change in\n",
      "\n",
      "you,’ asked his father, ‘now that you have heard this news? You are\n",
      "\n",
      "still the heir to my throne: I have made the army take an oath of\n",
      "\n",
      "loyalty to you and the emirs of the state are pledged to support you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the three gems, this one is for you.’ Sharkan bowed his head\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the ground and, being ashamed to dispute with his father,\n",
      "\n",
      "he accepted the gem and got up.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so angry, however, that he did not know what to do and\n",
      "\n",
      "he walked on until he entered Abriza’s palace. When he came to\n",
      "\n",
      "her, she rose to greet him and thanked him for what he had done,\n",
      "\n",
      "calling down blessings on him and on his father. She then sat down\n",
      "\n",
      "and made him sit beside her, but when he was seated, she saw the\n",
      "\n",
      "anger in his face and asked him about it. He told her that Sophia\n",
      "\n",
      "had given birth to two children by his father, a boy called Dau’ al-\n",
      "\n",
      "Makan and a girl, Nuzhat al-Zaman. He went on: ‘He gave them two\n",
      "\n",
      "of the gems and handed me one, which I left behind. It is only now\n",
      "\n",
      "that I have heard about this, although the children are six years old,\n",
      "\n",
      "and when my father told me, I was furious. Now I have explained\n",
      "\n",
      "the reason for my anger; I have kept nothing hidden from you and I\n",
      "\n",
      "am afraid for you lest my father marry you, for he loves you and I\n",
      "\n",
      "saw that he was showing his desire for you. What would you say if\n",
      "\n",
      "he wants this?’ ‘You must know, Sharkan,’ she said, ‘that your father\n",
      "\n",
      "has no authority over me and cannot take me against my will, while\n",
      "\n",
      "if he were to take me by force, I would kill myself. As for the three\n",
      "\n",
      "gems, it had not occurred to me that he would give any of them to\n",
      "\n",
      "any one of his children, for I thought that he would store them\n",
      "\n",
      "among his treasures. Now, of your kindness, I would like you to\n",
      "\n",
      "make me a present of the gem that your father gave you, if you\n",
      "\n",
      "accepted it from him.’ ‘To hear is to obey,’ he said, after which he\n",
      "\n",
      "handed it over to her. She told him to have no fear, and after talking\n",
      "\n",
      "to him for a time, she said: ‘I am afraid that if my father hears that I\n",
      "\n",
      "am with you, he will not let me be, but will make e\u0000orts to recover\n",
      "\n",
      "me. He and the emperor will come to terms, because of the\n",
      "\n",
      "emperor’s daughter Sophia, and the two of them will lead their\n",
      "\n",
      "armies against you and there will be a huge outcry.’ ‘My lady,’ said\n",
      "\n",

      "telling her to look after him and to spread out a rug for him. This\n",

      "then went o\u0000 to the market where he bought some rosewater and\n",

      "some sugar. He sprinkled the rosewater over Dau’ al-Makan’s face,\n",
      "\n",

      "chicken broth. When he had \u0000nished his meal, she fetched him hot\n",

      "now. ‘Praise be to God, I am well,’ Dau’ al-Makan replied, ‘and may\n",

      "hear that and he went out and brought a drink \u0000avoured with\n",

      "violets and rosewater, which he gave him. This man used to work in\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Dau’ al-Makan until morning. When the sun rose, he said: ‘You seem\n",
      "\n",
      "to have remembered your own land.’ ‘Yes,’ replied Dau’ al-Makan, ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "cannot stay here. I must say goodbye to you, for I am going to set\n",

      "\n",
      "her mind was preoccupied with thoughts of her brother. Thinking of\n",
      "\n",
      "her family and her homeland, she started to implore Almighty God\n",
      "\n",
      "to ward o\u0000 her misfortunes, and she recited these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "The night is dark; passion has stirred up sickness,\n",
      "\n",
      "While longing has aroused the pains I feel.\n",

      "Disturbing me, while longing burns my heart,\n",

      "As tears reveal the secret that was hidden.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know no way by which I can reach union,\n",
      "\n",
      "So as to banish the weakness disease has brought.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \u0000re of my heart is kindled by this longing\n",
      "\n",
      "While its blaze leaves the lover in distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "You blame me for my su\u0000ering; it is enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I endure what the pen of destiny has decreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I swear by love that I shall never be consoled,\n",
      "\n",
      "And oaths that lovers take remain inviolate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night, carry news of me to those who tell of love;\n",
      "\n",
      "Bear witness that you know I have not slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, shedding more tears, she started to walk, turning from one\n",
      "\n",
      "side to the other, until suddenly she came across an old man on his\n",
      "\n",
      "way from the desert with \u0000ve Bedouin. He turned towards her and\n",
      "\n",
      "saw that although she was beautiful, her head was covered with a\n",

      "torn cloak. He was amazed at her beauty and said to himself: ‘This is\n",
      "\n",
      "an astonishingly lovely girl, but she is in a squalid state. Whether\n",
      "\n",
      "she comes from this city or is a stranger, I must have her.’ He began\n",
      "\n",
      "to follow her slowly, until in a narrow place he crossed her path. He\n",
      "\n",
      "then called out, asking her about herself, and saying: ‘Little\n",

      "daughter, are you freeborn or are you a slave?’ When she heard this,\n",
      "\n",
      "she looked at him and said: ‘By your life, I implore you not to load\n",

      "me with any new sorrows.’ He said: ‘I had six daughters, but \u0000ve of\n",

      "\n",
      "shame, she said: ‘Uncle, I am a Bedouin girl, a stranger, and I have a\n",

      "\n",
      "stay with her by day and go back to my brother by night. If you\n",

      "agree to this, I shall come with you. I am a stranger here, but I was\n",

      "of high rank among my own people, although I am now lowly and\n",

      "wretched. My brother and I are from the Hijaz, and I’m afraid that\n",

      "\n",
      "she followed, and he then winked at his companions, who went on\n",

      "‘Najiya,’ this being the name that he had given her. When she heard\n",
      "\n",
      "him, she burst into tears and made no answer. The Bedouin turned\n",
      "\n",
      "to the merchant and said: ‘She is sitting here, so do you deal with\n",

      "her. Go to her, look at her and speak gently to her, as I told you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The merchant went in and stood there politely. He found that the\n",
      "\n",
      "girl was wonderfully beautiful, and, in particular, that she knew\n",
      "\n",
      "Arabic. ‘If she has the qualities you described,’ he told the Bedouin,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘thanks to her I shall get what I want from the sultan.’ He then\n",
      "\n",
      "greeted the girl and asked: ‘Little daughter, how are you?’ She\n",
      "\n",
      "turned to him and said: ‘That is written in the book of fate.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw that the newcomer was a respectable man with a\n",

      "come to buy me,’ adding: ‘If I refuse to have anything to do with\n",
      "\n",
      "him, I shall have to stay with this evil Bedouin and he will beat me\n",
      "\n",
      "to death. At all events, this one has a handsome face, and I can hope\n",
      "\n",
      "for better treatment from him than from this boor of a Bedouin. It\n",
      "\n",
      "may be that he has only come to listen to how I speak and so I will\n",
      "\n",
      "answer him politely.’ All the while her eyes had been \u0000xed on the\n",
      "\n",
      "ground, but now she looked up at him and said sweetly: ‘Peace be\n",
      "\n",
      "on you, sir, together with God’s mercy and his blessings, as this is a\n",
      "\n",
      "greeting enjoined by the Prophet. As for your question about how I\n",
      "\n",
      "am, if you want to know, mine is a state which you would not wish\n",
      "\n",
      "any but your enemies to experience.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She fell silent, leaving the merchant, who had been listening to\n",
      "\n",
      "her, beside himself with joy. He turned to the Bedouin and asked\n",
      "\n",
      "her price, saying that she was of noble blood. The man was angry\n",
      "\n",
      "and said: ‘You have spoiled the girl for me by saying this. Why do\n",
      "\n",
      "you say that she is of noble blood? She is only a miserable slave girl\n",
      "\n",
      "from the dregs of the people and I won’t sell her to you.’ When he\n",
      "\n",
      "heard this, the merchant realized that the man was a fool. ‘Don’t\n",
      "\n",
      "upset yourself,’ he said. ‘I shall buy her from you in spite of the\n",
      "\n",
      "defects that you have mentioned.’ ‘How much will you pay me for\n",
      "\n",
      "her?’ asked the Bedouin. ‘It is only the father who names the child,’\n",
      "\n",
      "replied the merchant. ‘Ask what you want.’ ‘It’s up to you to speak,’\n",
      "\n",
      "said the Bedouin. ‘This man is a hot-headed boor,’ the merchant told\n",
      "\n",
      "himself. ‘By God, I don’t know how to set a price on her, but she has\n",
      "\n",
      "won my heart with her eloquence and her beauty. If she can read\n",
      "\n",
      "and write, this would complete the good fortune that she would\n",
      "\n",
      "bring both to herself and to whoever buys her, but this Bedouin has\n",
      "\n",
      "no notion of her value.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So he turned to the man and said: ‘Shaikh of the Arabs, I’ll give\n",
      "\n",
      "you two hundred dinars clear pro\u0000t over and above the tax and the\n",
      "\n",
      "sultan’s dues.’ When he heard this, the Bedouin shouted furiously at\n",
      "\n",
      "him: ‘Be o\u0000 with you. By God, if you were to give me two hundred\n",
      "\n",
      "dinars for this bit of cloak that she is wearing, I wouldn’t sell it to\n",
      "\n",
      "you. I shan’t put her up for sale again, but I’ll keep her with me to\n",
      "\n",
      "pasture the camels and grind the \u0000our.’ Then he shouted to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come here, you stinking girl. I’m not going to sell you.’ Turning to\n",
      "\n",
      "the merchant, he said: ‘I thought you were a knowledgeable man,\n",
      "\n",
      "but I swear by my cap, that if you don’t leave at once, I’ll say things\n",
      "\n",
      "you won’t want to hear.’ ‘This fellow is mad,’ said the merchant to\n",
      "\n",
      "himself. ‘He doesn’t know the girl’s value, but I won’t say anything\n",
      "\n",
      "about her price to him now. If he were a sensible man, he wouldn’t\n",
      "\n",
      "swear by his cap. By God, the girl is worth Chosroe’s kingdom. I\n",
      "\n",
      "haven’t got the money with me to pay for her, but if he asks me for\n",
      "\n",
      "more, I’ll give him whatever he wants, even if he takes all that I\n",
      "\n",
      "have.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So he turned to the Bedouin and said: ‘Shaikh of the Arabs, be\n",
      "\n",
      "patient and don’t upset yourself, but tell me what you have for her\n",
      "\n",
      "in the way of clothes.’ ‘What kind of clothes suit a whore like this?\n",
      "\n",
      "By God, this cloak in which she is wrapped is more than enough for\n",
      "\n",
      "her.’ ‘By your leave,’ said the merchant, ‘I shall unveil her and\n",
      "\n",
      "examine her, front and back, as one examines a slave girl for sale.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do what you want, may God preserve your youth,’ said the\n",
      "\n",
      "Bedouin. ‘Examine her outside and inside, and if you want, strip o\u0000\n",
      "\n",
      "her clothes and look at her naked.’ ‘God forbid,’ said the merchant,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shall only look at her face.’ He then went up to her, abashed by\n",
      "\n",
      "her beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",

      "been allowed to say. Then, when it was the \u0000fty-seventh night, SHE\n",
      "CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that the merchant went up to her,\n",
      "\n",
      "abashed by her beauty. He sat down beside her and said: ‘Lady,\n",
      "\n",
      "what is your name?’ ‘Do you mean my present name,’ she said, ‘or\n",
      "\n",
      "my earlier one?’ ‘Do you have one name today and another\n",
      "\n",
      "yesterday?’ he asked. ‘Yes,’ she said. ‘I used to be called Nuzhat al-\n",

      "\n",
      "this, the merchant’s eyes \u0000lled with tears and he said: ‘Have you a\n",

      "\n",
      "Jerusalem on his sickbed.’ The merchant was astonished by the\n",
      "\n",
      "sweetness of her words and realized that the Bedouin had told the\n",
      "\n",
      "truth. Nuzhat al-Zaman then recalled her brother, his illness, his\n",
      "\n",
      "exile from home, how she had parted from him when he was sick,\n",
      "\n",
      "and how she did not know what had happened to him. She thought\n",
      "\n",
      "of her own experience with the Bedouin and of how far she was\n",

      "from her mother and father and her own land. The tears \u0000owed\n",
      "\n",
      "down her cheeks, and weeping, she recited these lines:\n",

      "You have travelled away but stay \u0000xed in my heart.\n",

      "While my tears pour down in \u0000oods.\n",

      "back to me without her.’ ‘To hear is to obey,’ replied the vizier. He\n",

      "\n",
      "for a king, together with whatever else was light to carry, but\n",
      "\n",
      "valuable. He collected Arab horses, mail coats made by Da’ud, and\n",

      "\n",
      "to him, and when the young man had recovered consciousness, he\n",
      "\n",
      "saw Taj al-Muluk standing by his head. He rose to his feet and\n",
      "\n",
      "kissed the ground before him, after which the prince asked him why\n",
      "\n",
      "he had not shown him his merchandise. ‘There is nothing among my\n",
      "\n",
      "goods that is suitable for your excellency,’ the young man replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "but Taj al-Muluk insisted on being shown what he had, as well as on\n",
      "\n",
      "being told what was the matter with him, adding: ‘I see that you are\n",
      "\n",
      "tearful and sad. If you have been wronged, I shall right the wrong,\n",
      "\n",
      "and if you are in debt, I shall pay it, for it has pained me to see you\n",

      "He then ordered chairs to be set out, and they fetched him one\n",

      "they spread out a silken carpet. Taj al-Muluk sat on the chair and\n",

      "the young man. ‘My goods are not \u0000t for you.’ Taj al-Muluk insisted,\n",
      "\n",
      "however, and told one of his servants to fetch them, whether or not\n",
      "\n",
      "he agreed. On seeing this, tears started from the young man’s eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wept, groaned, complained and sighed deeply. Then he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "I swear by the coquetry and the kohl of your eyes,\n",
      "\n",
      "By the soft lissomness of your form,\n",
      "\n",
      "By the wine and honey of your mouth,\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "There came an apparition sent by you, who are my hope,\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweeter than safety for the craven coward.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then opened up his goods and displayed them to Taj al-\n",
      "\n",
      "Muluk, one after the other, piece by piece. Among the things that he\n",
      "\n",
      "brought out was a satin robe with gold brocade worth two thousand\n",
      "\n",
      "dinars. When he unfolded this, a piece of material fell from the\n",
      "\n",
      "middle of it, which he quickly picked up and tucked beneath his\n",
      "\n",
      "hip. Then, in a daze, he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "When will the tortured heart \u0000nd a cure for your love?\n",
      "\n",
      "Union with you is farther than the Pleiades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distance, abandonment, longing and lovesickness,\n",
      "\n",
      "Delay, postponement – this is how life passes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Union does not bring life nor does abandonment kill me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distance does not bring me near, nor are you at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is neither fairness nor mercy that you show.\n",
      "\n",
      "You do not help me, but I cannot \u0000ee from you.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of my roads are blocked by love for you;\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot make out where I am to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taj al-Muluk was astonished at this recitation and wondered at\n",
      "\n",
      "the reason for it, not knowing why the young man had picked up\n",
      "\n",
      "the scrap of material and put it under his hip. So he asked what this\n",
      "\n",
      "was. ‘You don’t need to see it, master,’ replied the young man, and\n",
      "\n",
      "when the prince insisted, he said: ‘This was the reason why I refused\n",
      "\n",
      "to show you my goods, and I cannot let you see it.’\n",

      "Muluk: ‘This was the reason why I refused to show you my goods,\n",
      "\n",
      "and I cannot let you see it.’ ‘I must see it,’ insisted Taj al-Muluk, and\n",
      "\n",
      "as he was growing angry, the young man drew it out from under his\n",
      "\n",
      "hip, weeping, moaning, complaining and uttering many groans. He\n",
      "\n",
      "then recited these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not blame him, for blame is hurtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke the truth, but he does not listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask God to keep safe for me in the valley camping ground\n",
      "\n",
      "A moon that rises from the sphere of buttons.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said goodbye to him, but I would have preferred it\n",
      "\n",
      "Had pleasant life taken its leave of me before I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "How often did he plead with me on the morning of departure,\n",
      "\n",
      "As both my tears and his poured down.\n",
      "\n",
      "May God not give me the lie; parting from him\n",
      "\n",
      "Has torn my garment of excuse, but I shall patch it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no bed on which to lie, nor, since I left,\n",
      "\n",
      "Does any place of rest remain for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time did its best with its rough hand\n",
      "\n",
      "To ban me from good fortune and to ban him too.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the hand that poured out unmixed grief,\n",
      "\n",
      "Filling the cup from which he drank what I gave him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had \u0000nished, Taj al-Muluk said to him: ‘I see that you\n",
      "\n",
      "are in a wretched state, so tell me why it is that you weep when you\n",
      "\n",
      "look at this piece of material.’ When he heard the prince mention\n",
      "\n",
      "the material, the young man sighed and said: ‘Master, my story is a\n",
      "\n",
      "remarkable one and the a\u0000air that connects me with this material,\n",
      "\n",
      "its owner and the one who embroidered it with these shapes and\n",
      "\n",
      "images, is strange.’ At this, he unfolded the material and there on it\n",
      "\n",
      "was the picture of a gazelle embroidered in silk picked out with red\n",
      "\n",
      "gold, while opposite it was the picture of another gazelle, picked out\n",
      "\n",
      "in silver with a collar of red gold and three pendants of chrysolite.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Taj al-Muluk looked at this and saw its \u0000ne workmanship, he\n",
      "\n",
      "exclaimed: ‘Glory be to God for teaching man what he did not\n",
      "\n",
      "know.’ He then became passionately interested in the young man’s\n",
      "\n",
      "story and asked him to tell him how he was connected with the lady\n",
      "\n",
      "who had embroidered the gazelles.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Know, master,’ replied the young man, ‘that my father was one\n",
      "\n",
      "of the great merchants and I was his only son. I had a female cousin\n",
      "\n",
      "who was brought up with me in my father’s house, as her own\n",
      "\n",
      "father had died. Before his death, he had come to an agreement\n",
      "\n",
      "with my father that they should marry me to her. When we both\n",
      "\n",
      "reached puberty, she was not kept away from me and I was not kept\n",
      "\n",
      "away from her. My father then talked with my mother and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This year we shall draw up the marriage contract between ‘Aziz\n",
      "\n",
      "and ‘Aziza.” My mother agreed to this and my father started to lay\n",
      "\n",
      "in provisions for a banquet. While all this was going on, my cousin\n",
      "\n",
      "and I were sleeping in the same bed, in ignorance of all this, except\n",
      "\n",
      "that she knew more than I did, being better informed and more\n",
      "\n",
      "knowledgeable.’ he went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "My father then completed the wedding preparations and nothing\n",
      "\n",
      "remained except for the contract to be drawn up and the marriage\n",
      "\n",
      "consummated. My father wanted the contract to be signed after the\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday prayer, and he went to his friends among the merchants and\n",
      "\n",
      "others and told them about this, while my mother went and invited\n",
      "\n",
      "her women friends and her relatives. When Friday came, they\n",
      "\n",
      "washed out the hall that was prepared for the reception, cleaning\n",
      "\n",
      "the marble and spreading carpets in the house. Everything needed\n",
      "\n",
      "was set out there; the walls were adorned with brocaded hangings,\n",
      "\n",
      "and it was agreed that the guests should come to our house after the\n",
      "\n",
      "prayer. My father went o\u0000 to supervise the making of the\n",
      "\n",
      "sweetmeats and the sugared dishes, and as the only thing left was\n",
      "\n",
      "the drawing up of the marriage contract, my mother made me go o\u0000\n",
      "\n",
      "to the baths, sending after me a splendid new suit of clothes. I put\n",
      "\n",
      "these on when I came out of the baths and, as they were perfumed,\n",
      "\n",
      "a pleasant odour spread from them, scenting the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had meant to go to the Friday mosque, but then I remembered a\n",
      "\n",
      "friend of mine and went back to look for him in order to invite him\n",
      "\n",
      "to the signing of the marriage contract, telling myself that this\n",
      "\n",
      "would keep me busy until close to the time of prayer. I went into a\n",
      "\n",
      "lane where I had never been before, and I was sweating because of\n",
      "\n",
      "my bath and also because of the new clothes that I had on. As the\n",
      "\n",
      "sweat ran down, the scent grew stronger and I rested on a bench at\n",
      "\n",
      "the head of the lane, spreading out an embroidered kerchief that I\n",
      "\n",
      "had with me to sit on. It grew hotter and although sweat covered\n",
      "\n",
      "my forehead and poured down my face, I could not wipe it away\n",
      "\n",
      "with the kerchief because I was sitting on it. I was about to use my\n",
      "\n",
      "gown when suddenly from above me a white kerchief fell, more\n",
      "\n",
      "delicate than the zephyr and more delightful to the eye than a sick\n",
      "\n",
      "man’s cure. I caught it in my hand and looked up to see where it\n",
      "\n",
      "had come from. My gaze then fell on that of the gazelle lady…\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",
      "\n",
      "been allowed to say. Then, when it was the one hundred and\n",
      "\n",
      "thirteenth night, SHE CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that THE YOUNG MAN TOLD TAJ AL-\n",
      "\n",
      "MULUK:\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked up to see where it had come from. My gaze then fell on\n",
      "\n",
      "that of the gazelle lady, who was looking out of a window with a\n",
      "\n",
      "lattice of brass. I had never seen anyone more beautiful; indeed, my\n",
      "\n",
      "tongue cannot describe her. When she saw me looking at her, she\n",
      "\n",
      "put one \u0000nger in her mouth, and then, joining her middle \u0000nger to\n",
      "\n",
      "her index \u0000nger, she placed them on her bosom between her\n",
      "\n",
      "breasts. She then withdrew her head from the window, closing it\n",
      "\n",
      "and disappearing from sight. Fire broke out in my heart; the \u0000ames\n",
      "\n",
      "spread; my one glance was followed by a thousand regrets, and I\n",
      "\n",
      "was bewildered. I had not been able to hear anything she said, nor\n",
      "\n",
      "had I understood her gestures. I looked at the window again, but\n",
      "\n",
      "found it closed, and although I waited until sunset, I heard no sound\n",
      "\n",
      "and saw no one. Despairing of catching sight of her again, I got up\n",
      "\n",
      "from my place, taking the kerchief with me and unfolding it. The\n",
      "\n",
      "scent of musk spread from it, so delighting me that I imagined\n",
      "\n",
      "myself to be in Paradise.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I spread it out between my \u0000ngers, a small piece of paper fell\n",
      "\n",
      "from it. I opened this up and found that it was impregnated with the\n",
      "\n",
      "purest of scents, while on it were written these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "I sent him a note complaining of my love,\n",
      "\n",
      "Written in a delicate hand – and scripts are of all kinds.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend said: ‘Why do you write like this,\n",
      "\n",
      "So delicately and \u0000nely that it is hardly to be seen?’\n",
      "\n",
      "I said: ‘That is because I am worn away and thin;\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what happens to the script of lovers.’\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading these lines, I studied the beautiful kerchief and saw\n",
      "\n",
      "the following lines on one of its borders:\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, that excellent calligrapher,\n",
      "\n",
      "Wrote two lines on his cheek in ornamental script.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he appears, the sun and moon become confused,\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he bends, branches are put to shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the opposite border were these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Down wrote with ambergris upon a pearl\n",
      "\n",
      "Two lines of jet inscribed upon an apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is death in the glance of languorous eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "And drunkenness in cheeks, not in the wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I saw the verses that were embroidered on the kerchief,\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000re spread through my heart and my longings and cares increased. I\n",
      "\n",
      "took the kerchief and the note and brought them back home, not\n",
      "\n",
      "knowing how to reach my beloved or how to particularize the\n",
      "\n",
      "generalities of love. Some of the night had already passed before I\n",
      "\n",
      "reached the house, and there I saw my cousin ‘Aziza sitting\n",
      "\n",
      "weeping. When she saw me, she wiped away her tears; coming up to\n",
      "\n",
      "me, she took o\u0000 my robe and asked me why I had been absent. All\n",
      "\n",
      "the emirs, she told me, together with the great men, the merchants\n",
      "\n",
      "and others, had assembled in the house. The qadis and the notaries\n",
      "\n",
      "had been there; they had eaten all the food and stayed sitting for a\n",
      "\n",
      "time, waiting for me to come for the signing of the contract. ‘When\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000nally they gave up hope of you,’ she went on, ‘they dispersed and\n",
      "\n",
      "each went his way. Your father was furious at that and swore that\n",
      "\n",
      "he would not draw up the marriage contract until next year, because\n",

      "of all the money that he had spent on the wedding feast.’\n",

      "to cause all this trouble by my absence. ‘Cousin,’ I said to her, ‘don’t\n",

      "ask what happened to me,’ but then I told her about the kerchief\n",

      "and explained things from start to \u0000nish. She took the paper and the\n",
      "\n",
      "kerchief and read what was written on them, with tears running\n",
      "\n",
      "down her cheeks. She then recited these lines:\n",

      "If someone says: ‘Love starts with choice,’ tell them:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is a lie; it all comes from necessity.’\n",

      "and fell fast asleep. She took a fan and sat by my head, fanning my\n",

      "face until the end of the day. She then woke me up, and when I was\n",
      "\n",
      "roused, I found her sitting by my head, fan in hand, weeping. The\n",
      "\n",
      "tears had dampened her dress. When she saw that I was awake, she\n",
      "\n",
      "wiped them away and brought me some food. When I refused this,\n",
      "\n",
      "she said: ‘Didn’t I tell you to listen to me? Eat,’ and so I ate\n",
      "\n",
      "obediently. She started to put the food in my mouth and I chewed it\n",

      "until I was full. Then she gave me sugared jujube juice to drink; she\n",
      "\n",
      "washed my hands and dried them with a kerchief, after which she\n",
      "\n",
      "sprinkled me with rosewater and I sat with her, feeling in perfect\n",

      "health. When night fell, she gave me my robe to put on and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Cousin, stay awake for the whole night and don’t go to sleep. She\n",
      "\n",
      "will not come until the last part of the night, and if it is God’s will,\n",
      "\n",
      "you will be united with her, but don’t forget my instructions.’ Then\n",
      "\n",
      "she wept, and I was pained at heart by all those tears of hers and I\n",
      "\n",
      "asked what instructions they were that she meant. ‘When you leave\n",
      "\n",
      "her,’ she said, ‘recite the lines that I quoted to you earlier.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I then left cheerfully and went to the garden, where I went up to\n",
      "\n",
      "the room and sat down, feeling sated and staying wakeful for the\n",

      "\u0000rst quarter of the night. I sat there for what seemed like a year, but\n",
      "\n",
      "I still stayed awake until three quarters of it had gone and the cocks\n",
      "\n",
      "had crowed. This prolonged wakefulness made me very hungry, so I\n",
      "\n",
      "got up and went to the table, where I ate my \u0000ll. My head felt heavy\n",
      "\n",
      "and I was about to fall asleep when I saw a light approaching from a\n",

      "distance. I got up, washed my hands and my mouth and roused\n",
      "\n",
      "myself. It was not long before the lady came, surrounded by ten\n",
      "\n",
      "slave girls, like a moon among stars. She was wearing a dress of\n",
      "\n",
      "green satin, embroidered with red gold. She was as the poet has\n",
      "\n",
      "described:\n",
      "\n",
      "She comes walking proudly to her lovers dressed in green,\n",
      "\n",
      "With buttons undone and her hair unloosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is your name?’ I asked her and she said:\n",

      "‘I am she who has burned lovers’ hearts on coals of \u0000re.’\n",
      "\n",
      "I complained to her of love’s hardships I endured;\n",
      "\n",
      "She said: ‘In your ignorance you complain to rock.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Although your heart be rock,’ I said,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yet God has brought pure water out of rock.’\n",

      "lip, I kissed her lower lip. I stretched out my hand to her waist and\n",
      "\n",
      "squeezed it and we both came to the ground at the same time. She\n",
      "\n",
      "undid her drawers, which slipped down to her anklets. We started\n",
      "\n",
      "our love play, with embraces, coquetry, soft words, bites, twining of\n",
      "\n",
      "legs, and a circumambulation of the House and its corners. This\n",
      "\n",
      "went on until her joints relaxed and she fainted away, losing\n",

      "In which I did not let the wine cup slacken in its work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kept my eyelids from their sleep\n",

      "And joined the girl’s earring to her anklet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We slept together until morning. I then wanted to leave, but she\n",

      "pictured like this. I was \u0000lled with admiration for it and I took it,\n",
      "\n",
      "arranging with her that I should come to her every night in that\n",

      "attention was this gazelle,’ and I threw down the piece of material\n",
      "\n",
      "in front of her. She became very agitated and, being unable to\n",
      "\n",
      "control herself, she shed tears and recited these lines:\n",

      "And do not be deceived by an embrace.\n",

      "written on it. When the time came for me to go, she said: ‘Go in\n",

      "me and made me sit on her lap. We then ate, drank and satis\u0000ed our\n",

      "remembering his cousin, wept too. They continued to shed tears\n",
      "\n",
      "until morning came. Taj al-Muluk then got up and went to see his\n",

      "The way is long; cares and disquiet have increased;\n",

      "You who are my desire and the goal of my hopes, I have\n",

      "By Him who created man from a clot of blood,\n",
      "\n",
      "The sleepless passion I have borne, you who are my wish,\n",

      "Is more than lofty mountains have to bear.\n",

      "\n",
      "I would not leave on such a journey now.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had \u0000nished his recitation, he wept, as did ‘Aziz, whose\n",
      "\n",
      "heart was wounded. The vizier felt pity for their tears, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Master, set your heart at rest and take comfort, for nothing but\n",
      "\n",
      "good will come of this.’ ‘This has been a long journey, vizier,’ said\n",

      "crossing valleys, rugged ridges and desert wastes.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night, when Taj al-Muluk was sleeping, he dreamt that his\n",
      "\n",
      "beloved was with him and that he was embracing her and clasping\n",
      "\n",
      "her to his breast. Waking in alarm with his wits astray, he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "My two companions, my heart is astray and my tears fall;\n",
      "\n",
      "I am \u0000lled with passion; infatuation clings to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My tearful lament is that of a woman who has lost her child;\n",

      "In the darkness of night I moan as moans the dove.\n",

      "If the wind blows from your land,\n",
      "\n",
      "I \u0000nd a coolness spreading over the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I send you my greetings when the east wind blows,\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as ringdoves \u0000y and pigeons moan.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had \u0000nished reciting these lines, the vizier came up to\n",
      "\n",
      "him and said: ‘Be glad; this is a good sign, so set your heart at rest\n",
      "\n",
      "and take comfort, for you are certain to reach your goal.’ ‘Aziz went\n",
      "\n",
      "up to him to urge him to have patience, entertaining him, talking to\n",
      "\n",
      "him and telling him stories. They continued to press on with their\n",
      "\n",
      "journey, travelling day and night for another two months. Then one\n",
      "\n",
      "day when the sun rose they saw in the distance something white.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taj al-Muluk asked ‘Aziz what it was and he replied: ‘Master, that is\n",
      "\n",
      "the White Castle and this is the city that you have been making for.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Taj al-Muluk was glad, and he and the others went on until they\n",
      "\n",
      "came close to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point the prince was transported by joy, and care and\n",
      "\n",
      "sorrow fell away from him. He and his companions entered the city\n",
      "\n",
      "disguised as traders, with Taj al-Muluk dressed as a merchant\n",
      "\n",
      "prince. They went to a large hostel known as the merchants’ khan\n",
      "\n",
      "and Taj al-Muluk asked ‘Aziz if it was where merchants stayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ replied ‘Aziz, ‘and it is where I lodged myself.’ So they halted\n",
      "\n",
      "there, making their camels kneel and unsaddling them, after which\n",
      "\n",
      "they put their goods in the storehouses and rested for four days. The\n",
      "\n",
      "vizier then advised them to rent a larger house. They agreed and\n",
      "\n",
      "hired a spacious property, well adapted for feasts, and there they\n",
      "\n",
      "took up their quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vizier and ‘Aziz spent their time trying to come up with a\n",
      "\n",
      "plan for Taj al-Muluk, while he himself was at a loss, with no idea\n",
      "\n",
      "what to do except to take his wares to the silk bazaar. The vizier\n",
      "\n",
      "approached him and ‘Aziz, saying: ‘If we stay here like this, then\n",
      "\n",
      "you can be sure that we shall not get what we want or carry out our\n",
      "\n",
      "mission. I have thought of something which, God willing, may\n",
      "\n",
      "produce a good result.’ ‘Do whatever occurs to you,’ said the others,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘for old men are fortunate and this is especially true of you, thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "to your experience of a\u0000airs. So tell us what you have thought of.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My advice,’ the vizier said to Taj al-Muluk, ‘is that we should take a\n",
      "\n",
      "booth for you in the silk market where you should sit, buying and\n",
      "\n",
      "selling. Everyone of whatever class, upper or lower, needs pieces of\n",
      "\n",
      "silk, and if you sit there quietly, God willing, you will succeed in\n",
      "\n",
      "your a\u0000air, especially because of your good looks. Make ‘Aziz your\n",
      "\n",
      "agent, so that he can sit inside the booth to hand you the various\n",
      "\n",
      "items and materials.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When he heard this, Taj al-Muluk agreed that it was a good and\n",
      "\n",
      "sound idea. He took out a splendid set of merchant’s clothes, put\n",
      "\n",
      "them on and walked o\u0000, followed by his servants, to whom he had\n",
      "\n",
      "given a thousand dinars in order to set the new place to rights. They\n",
      "\n",
      "went on until they reached the silk market, and when the merchants\n",
      "\n",
      "saw Taj al-Muluk and noted how handsome he was, they were taken\n",
      "\n",
      "aback. ‘Ridwan has opened the gates of Paradise and forgotten to\n",
      "\n",
      "close them again, and so this wonderfully handsome young man has\n",

      "come out,’ said one. ‘Perhaps he is an angel!’ exclaimed another.\n",
      "\n",
      "When his party came to the merchants, they asked where the market\n",
      "\n",
      "superintendent had his booth. They were given directions and\n",
      "\n",
      "walked on until they found it. They greeted him and he and the\n",
      "\n",
      "merchants who were with him rose to meet them, invited them to\n",
      "\n",
      "sit and treated them with honour. This was because of the vizier,\n",
      "\n",
      "whom they saw to be a digni\u0000ed old man. On noting that he was\n",
      "\n",
      "accompanied by the young Taj al-Muluk and by ‘Aziz, they said to\n",
      "\n",
      "themselves: ‘There is no doubt that this old man is the father of the\n",
      "\n",
      "two young ones.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The vizier asked which of them was the superintendent of the\n",
      "\n",
      "market. ‘This is he,’ they said, and the man came forward. The vizier\n",
      "\n",
      "looked at him, studied him and found him to be a venerable and\n",
      "\n",
      "digni\u0000ed old man, with eunuchs, servants and black slaves. The old\n",
      "\n",
      "man gave the visitors a friendly greeting, treating them with the\n",
      "\n",
      "greatest honour, and after making them sit beside him, he asked\n",
      "\n",
      "whether they had any need that he might be able to ful\u0000l. ‘Yes,’ said\n",
      "\n",
      "the vizier. ‘I am an old man, stricken in years, and I have with me\n",
      "\n",
      "these two young men with whom I have travelled to many regions\n",

      "a whole year so that they could see its sights and get to know its\n",

      "people. I have now arrived at this town of yours, and as I have\n",
      "\n",
      "chosen to stay here, I want you to provide me with a \u0000ne booth in a\n",
      "\n",
      "good situation where I can set them down to trade and to inspect\n",
      "\n",
      "the city, while adapting themselves to the manners of its people,\n",
      "\n",
      "and learning how to buy and sell, give and take.’ ‘There is no\n",
      "\n",
      "problem with that,’ said the superintendent, as he had been glad to\n",
      "\n",
      "see the two young men, for whom he felt a surge of love, he being\n",
      "\n",
      "someone who was passionately fond of murderous glances and who\n",
      "\n",
      "preferred the love of boys to that of girls, inclining to the sour\n",
      "\n",
      "rather than the sweet. To himself he said: ‘This is a \u0000ne catch –\n",
      "\n",
      "praise be to Him who created and fashioned them from vile sperm!’\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and stood before them as a gesture of respect like a\n",
      "\n",
      "servant, after which he made ready for them a booth in the covered\n",
      "\n",
      "market. In size and splendour it was unsurpassed, being roomy and\n",
      "\n",
      "well decorated, with shelves of ivory and ebony. The keys were\n",
      "\n",
      "handed to the vizier, dressed as he was as an elderly merchant, and\n",
      "\n",
      "the superintendent said to him: ‘Take these, master, and may God\n",

      "bless this place for your sons.’ The vizier took the keys and the three\n",

      "\n",
      "and told the servants to move all their goods, materials and\n",
      "\n",
      "treasures. There was a great deal of stu\u0000, worth huge amounts of\n",
      "\n",
      "money; all of it was shifted and they themselves went to the booth\n",
      "\n",
      "where it was stored. They spent the night there and in the morning\n",
      "\n",
      "the vizier took the two young men to the baths. They made full use\n",
      "\n",
      "of these, washing and cleaning themselves, putting on splendid\n",
      "\n",
      "clothes and applying perfume. Each of them was dazzlingly\n",
      "\n",
      "handsome and their appearance in the baths \u0000tted the poet’s lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Good news it was for the bath man when his hand met\n",
      "\n",
      "A body created from a mix of water and of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "He continued with his delicate artistry,\n",
      "\n",
      "Plucking musk from an image made of camphor.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came out, the market superintendent, who had heard\n",
      "\n",
      "where they had gone, was sitting waiting for them. They moved\n",
      "\n",
      "forward like gazelles, with red cheeks, dark eyes and shining faces,\n",
      "\n",
      "like two brilliant moons or two branches laden with fruit. When the\n",
      "\n",
      "superintendent saw them, he rose to his feet and said: ‘My sons, may\n",
      "\n",
      "the baths always bring you comfort.’ In return, Taj al-Muluk said\n",
      "\n",
      "pleasantly: ‘May God grant you grace, father. Why did you not come\n",
      "\n",
      "and bathe with us?’ He and ‘Aziz then bent over the man’s hand and\n",
      "\n",
      "kissed it, after which they walked in front of him to the booth as a\n",
      "\n",
      "token of respect and reverence, since he was the leader of the\n",
      "\n",
      "merchants and the superintendent of the market, and he had already\n",
      "\n",
      "done them a favour by giving them the booth. When he saw their\n",
      "\n",
      "buttocks swaying, his passion increased; he snorted in his\n",
      "\n",
      "excitement and was unable to restrain himself, but staring \u0000xedly at\n",
      "\n",
      "them, he recited these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart studies the chapter devoted to him,\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading nothing that covers partnership with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not surprising that weight causes him to sway;\n",
      "\n",
      "How many movements are there in the revolving sphere?\n",
      "\n",
      "He also recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "My eye saw the two of them walking on the earth,\n",
      "\n",
      "And I wished they had been walking on my eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they heard what he said, they insisted that he go a second\n",
      "\n",
      "time with them to the baths. Scarcely able to believe this, he hurried\n",
      "\n",
      "back and they went in with him. The vizier had not yet left and\n",
      "\n",
      "when he heard that the superintendent was there, he came out and\n",
      "\n",
      "met him in the middle of the bath house and invited him to enter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He refused, but Taj al-Muluk took one of his hands and ‘Aziz the\n",
      "\n",
      "other and they brought him to a private room. The evil old man\n",
      "\n",
      "allowed himself to be led by them and his passion increased. Taj al-\n",
      "\n",
      "Muluk swore that he and he alone should wash him, while ‘Aziz\n",
      "\n",
      "swore that none but he should pour the water over him. Although\n",
      "\n",
      "this was what he wanted, he refused, but the vizier said: ‘They are\n",

      "your sons; let them wash you and clean you.’ ‘My God preserve\n",
      "\n",
      "them for you,’ said the superintendent. ‘By God, your arrival and\n",
      "\n",
      "that of your companions has brought blessing and fortune to our\n",
      "\n",
      "city.’ He then recited the lines:\n",

      "You have come and our hills are clothed in green;\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever looks can see they bloom with \u0000owers.\n",

      "But our stay there cannot be long.\n",

      "\n",
      "them and he quoted:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is many a chamber whose \u0000owers are solid stone,\n",

      "Elegant when \u0000res are kindled round about.\n",

      "where they opened their booth. The servants had put this in\n",

      "placed two couches, each worth a hundred dinars and each covered\n",

      "\n",
      "around, so enabling them to sell some of their goods and their\n",

      "Dunya. He kept repeating this for some days and nights, and being\n",
      "\n",
      "disturbed at heart, he was unable to sleep or rest. Love had him in\n",
      "\n",
      "its grip, and his passion and lovesickness grew worse, while the\n",

      "sitting there, he was suddenly approached by an old woman,\n",
      "\n",
      "followed by two slave girls. She walked up and stood by the shop\n",

      "and when she saw his symmetrical physique, his beauty and\n",
      "\n",
      "elegance, she admired his gracefulness and her harem trousers\n",
      "\n",
      "became damp. ‘Glory to the One who created you from vile sperm\n",
      "\n",
      "and made you a temptation for those who look at you!’ she\n",
      "\n",
      "exclaimed. Then, after studying him, she added: ‘This is not a mortal\n",
      "\n",
      "man but a noble angel.’ She approached and greeted him; he\n",
      "\n",
      "returned the greeting and rose to his feet with a smile, being\n",
      "\n",
      "prompted in all this by gestures from ‘Aziz. Asking her to sit beside\n",
      "\n",
      "him, he began to fan her until she was refreshed and rested. She\n",
      "\n",
      "then turned to him and said: ‘My son, you are a pattern of all\n",
      "\n",
      "perfection: do you come from these parts?’ Taj al-Muluk replied\n",
      "\n",
      "eloquently, in pleasant and agreeable tones: ‘My lady, this is the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000rst time that I have ever been here in my life and I have only\n",
      "\n",
      "stopped here in order to look at the sights.’ She spoke words of\n",
      "\n",
      "welcome and then asked: ‘What materials have you brought with\n",
      "\n",
      "you? Show me something beautiful, for that is the only thing that\n",
      "\n",
      "can be worn by the beautiful.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Taj al-Muluk heard this, his heart \u0000uttered and he could\n",
      "\n",
      "not grasp what she meant, but ‘Aziz made a sign to him and he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have here everything that you could want. I have what will suit\n",
      "\n",
      "only kings or the daughters of kings, so tell me for whom it is that\n",
      "\n",
      "you need this, in order that I can put out for you everything that\n",
      "\n",
      "might be appropriate.’ By saying this he hoped to \u0000nd out what she\n",
      "\n",
      "really meant. In reply she said: ‘I want something suitable for\n",
      "\n",
      "Princess Dunya, the daughter of King Shahriman.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Overjoyed to hear this reference to his beloved, Taj al-Muluk told\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Aziz to fetch him a particular package. ‘Aziz brought it and opened\n",
      "\n",
      "it in front of him, after which Taj al-Muluk told the old woman:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Choose what will suit her, for this is something that you will \u0000nd\n",
      "\n",
      "nowhere else.’ The old woman picked on something that was worth\n",
      "\n",
      "a thousand dinars, and asked its price, while, as she talked to him,\n",
      "\n",
      "she was rubbing the palm of her hand between her thighs. ‘Am I to\n",

      "God who has let me come to know you,’ said Taj al-Muluk. ‘May\n",
      "\n",
      "God’s Name guard you,’ she replied. ‘I ask the protection of the Lord\n",
      "\n",
      "of the dawn for your beautiful face. A beautiful face and an eloquent\n",
      "\n",
      "tongue – happy is she who sleeps in your embrace, clasps your body\n",
      "\n",
      "and enjoys your youth, especially if she is as beautiful as you!’ Taj\n",
      "\n",
      "al-Muluk laughed until he fell over, exclaiming: ‘You Who ful\u0000l\n",

      "The woman asked his name and on being told that it was Taj al-\n",
      "\n",
      "Muluk, she said: ‘This is a name for kings and princes, but you are\n",
      "\n",
      "dressed as a merchant.’ ‘Aziz said: ‘It was because of the love and\n",
      "\n",
      "a\u0000ection that his parents and his family had for him that they called\n",
      "\n",

      "you from the evil eye and from the evil of your enemies and the\n",
      "\n",
      "envious, even though your beauty causes hearts to break.’ She then\n",
      "\n",
      "took the material and went on her way, still dazed by his beauty\n",

      "\n",
      "said: ‘Here it is, lady; turn it over and look at it.’ Dunya was\n",

      "\n",
      "came the young man who sold me this material. I wish that he could\n",

      "\n",
      "and you have lost your wits!’ Then she added: ‘Bring me the\n",

      "\n",
      "her, she looked at it for a second time and saw that, albeit small, it\n",
      "\n",
      "was precious. She admired it, as never in her life had she seen its\n",

      "the most beautiful thing on the face of the earth.’ The princess\n",

      "enquired: ‘Did you ask him to tell us whether there is any need he\n",

      "took the pen in his hand and wrote these lines:\n",

      "\n",
      "or rent it?’ ‘It’s not mine,’ replied the gardener. ‘It belongs to the\n",
      "\n",
      "king’s daughter, Princess Dunya.’ ‘What is your monthly pay?’ asked\n",
      "\n",
      "the vizier. ‘One dinar, and no more,’ replied the man. The vizier\n",
      "\n",
      "looked at the garden and saw that it contained a high pavilion, but\n",
      "\n",
      "that this was old. He then said to the gardener: ‘Shaikh, I would like\n",
      "\n",
      "to do a good deed by which you may remember me.’ When the man\n",
      "\n",
      "asked him what he was thinking of, by way of reply he said: ‘Accept\n",
      "\n",
      "these three hundred dinars.’ When the gardener heard him talk of\n",
      "\n",
      "gold, he said: ‘Master, do whatever you want.’ The vizier gave him\n",
      "\n",
      "the money and said: ‘If it is the will of Almighty God, we shall\n",
      "\n",
      "achieve something good here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The three then left the gardener and went back to their house,\n",
      "\n",
      "where they passed the night. The next day, the vizier summoned a\n",
      "\n",
      "house painter, an artist and a skilled goldsmith, and he produced for\n",
      "\n",
      "them all the tools they would need. He took them into the garden\n",
      "\n",
      "and told them to whitewash the pavilion and to decorate it with\n",
      "\n",
      "various kinds of pictures. He had gold and lapis lazuli fetched and\n",
      "\n",
      "he told the artist to produce on one side of the hall a picture of a\n",
      "\n",
      "hunter who had spread a net into which birds had fallen, with a\n",
      "\n",
      "female pigeon entangled by its beak. When the artist had painted\n",
      "\n",
      "this, the vizier told him to repeat the motif on the other side of the\n",
      "\n",
      "hall, with the pigeon alone captured by the hunter, who had put a\n",
      "\n",
      "knife to its throat. Opposite this there was to be the picture of a\n",
      "\n",
      "great hawk which had seized the male pigeon and sunk its claws\n",
      "\n",
      "into it. The artist completed the painting and when all three had\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000nished the tasks set them by the vizier, he paid them their wages\n",
      "\n",
      "and they went o\u0000, as did the vizier and his companions. After taking\n",
      "\n",
      "leave of the gardener, they went home and sat talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taj al-Muluk said to ‘Aziz: ‘Recite me some poetry, brother, so as\n",
      "\n",
      "to cheer me and to remove these cares of mine, cooling the raging\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000re in my heart.’ At that, ‘Aziz chanted the following lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "All the grief of which lovers talk\n",
      "\n",
      "Is mine alone, exhausting endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you wish to be watered by my tears,\n",
      "\n",
      "Their seas will serve all those who come for water,\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you wish to see what lovers su\u0000er,\n",
      "\n",
      "From the power of passion, then look at my body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shedding tears, he went on to recite:\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever does not love graceful necks and eyes,\n",
      "\n",
      "But still lays claim to worldly pleasure, does not tell the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love holds a concept that cannot be grasped\n",
      "\n",
      "By any man except for those who love.\n",
      "\n",
      "May God not move love’s burden from my heart,\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor take away the sleeplessness from my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He next chanted the following lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "In his Canon, Avicenna claims\n",
      "\n",
      "That music is the lover’s cure,\n",
      "\n",
      "Together with union with one like his love,\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as wine, a garden and dried fruits.\n",
      "\n",
      "To \u0000nd a cure, I chose a di\u0000erent girl,\n",
      "\n",
      "Aided by fate and opportunity,\n",
      "\n",
      "Only to \u0000nd that lovesickness is fatal,\n",
      "\n",
      "While Avicenna’s ‘cure’ is senseless talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "When ‘Aziz had \u0000nished his poem, Taj al-Muluk was astonished\n",
      "\n",
      "at his eloquence and the excellence of his recitation and told him\n",
      "\n",
      "that he had removed some of his cares. The vizier then said: ‘Among\n",
      "\n",
      "the experiences of the ancients are some that leave the hearer lost in\n",
      "\n",
      "wonder.’ ‘If you remember anything of this kind,’ Taj al-Muluk said,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘let me hear what you can produce in the way of delicate poetry and\n",
      "\n",
      "long stories.’ The vizier then chanted these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to think that union could be bought\n",
      "\n",
      "By prized possessions and payment of cattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ignorance I thought your love too inconsiderable\n",
      "\n",
      "A thing on which to waste a precious life.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was before I saw you make your choice\n",
      "\n",
      "And single out your beloved with choice gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realized there was no stratagem for me\n",
      "\n",
      "To reach you, and I tucked my head beneath my wing,\n",
      "\n",
      "Making my home within the nest of love,\n",
      "\n",
      "Where endlessly I must pass all my days.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much, then, for them, but as for the old woman, she remained\n",
      "\n",
      "isolated in her house. It happened that the princess felt a longing to\n",
      "\n",
      "take a walk in the garden. As she would not go out without the old\n",
      "\n",
      "woman, she sent a message and made her peace with her,\n",
      "\n",
      "reconciling her and telling her that she wanted to go out into the\n",
      "\n",
      "garden to look at the trees and their fruits and to enjoy herself\n",
      "\n",
      "among the \u0000owers. The old woman agreed to go with her but said\n",
      "\n",
      "that she \u0000rst wanted to return home to change her clothes before\n",
      "\n",
      "coming back. ‘Go home, then,’ the princess said, ‘but don’t be long.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman left her and went to Taj al-Muluk. ‘Get ready,’ she\n",
      "\n",
      "said. ‘Put on your most splendid clothes, go to the garden and, after\n",
      "\n",
      "you have greeted the gardener, hide yourself there.’ ‘To hear is to\n",
      "\n",
      "obey,’ he replied, and they agreed between themselves on a signal,\n",
      "\n",
      "after which the old woman returned to Princess Dunya.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had left, the vizier and ‘Aziz dressed Taj al-Muluk in\n",
      "\n",
      "the most splendid of royal robes, worth \u0000ve thousand dinars, and\n",
      "\n",
      "around his waist they fastened a girdle of gold set with gems and\n",
      "\n",
      "precious stones. They then set o\u0000 for the garden, and when they\n",
      "\n",
      "reached its gate, they found the gardener sitting there. When he saw\n",
      "\n",
      "Taj al-Muluk, he got to his feet and greeted him with reverence and\n",
      "\n",
      "honour, opening the gate for him and saying: ‘Come in and look\n",
      "\n",
      "around the garden.’ He did not know that the princess was going to\n",
      "\n",
      "visit it that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taj al-Muluk went in, but he had been there for only an hour\n",
      "\n",
      "when he heard a noise, and before he knew what was happening,\n",
      "\n",
      "the eunuchs and the slave girls had come out of the postern gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the gardener saw them, he went to tell Taj al-Muluk, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Master, what are we going to do, for my lady, Princess Dunya, is\n",
      "\n",
      "here?’ ‘No harm will come to you,’ said Taj al-Muluk, ‘for I shall\n",
      "\n",
      "hide myself somewhere in the garden.’ The man told him to be very\n",
      "\n",
      "careful, and then left him and went o\u0000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The princess entered the garden with her maids and the old\n",
      "\n",
      "woman, who told herself: ‘If the eunuchs come with us, we shall not\n",
      "\n",
      "get what we want.’ She then said to the princess: ‘Lady, I can tell\n",
      "\n",
      "you how best to relax,’ and after the princess had told her to speak,\n",
      "\n",
      "she went on: ‘We don’t need these eunuchs now; you can’t relax as\n",
      "\n",
      "long as they are with us, so send them o\u0000.’ The princess agreed and\n",
      "\n",
      "sent the eunuchs away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after that, she began to walk, while, unbeknown to her, Taj\n",
      "\n",
      "al-Muluk was watching her in all her beauty. Every time he looked,\n",
      "\n",
      "he would lose his senses because of her surpassing loveliness. The\n",
      "\n",
      "old woman kept talking to her mistress in order to inveigle her into\n",
      "\n",
      "approaching the pavilion, which had been painted as the vizier had\n",
      "\n",
      "instructed. The princess entered it and looked at the paintings,\n",
      "\n",
      "where she saw the birds, the hunter and the pigeons. ‘Glory be to\n",
      "\n",
      "God!’ she exclaimed. ‘This is exactly what I saw in my dream.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking with amazement at the pictures of the birds, the hunter and\n",
      "\n",
      "the net, she said: ‘Nurse, I used to blame men and hate them, but\n",
      "\n",
      "look at how the hunter has cut the throat of the female pigeon. The\n",
      "\n",
      "male escaped, but he was going to come and rescue his mate when\n",
      "\n",
      "he was met by the hawk, which seized him.’ The old woman,\n",
      "\n",
      "pretending to know nothing about this, kept her occupied with\n",
      "\n",
      "conversation until the two of them came close to Taj al-Muluk’s\n",
      "\n",
      "hiding place.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then gestured to get Taj al-Muluk to walk beneath the\n",
      "\n",
      "windows of the pavilion, and the princess, who was standing there,\n",
      "\n",
      "happened to turn. She caught sight of Taj al-Muluk and had the\n",
      "\n",
      "chance to study his beauty and his symmetrical form. ‘Where has\n",
      "\n",
      "this handsome young man come from, nurse?’ she asked. ‘I know\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing about him,’ the old woman told her, ‘but I think that he\n",
      "\n",
      "must be the son of a great king, for he is handsome and beautiful to\n",
      "\n",
      "the furthest degree.’ Princess Dunya fell in love; the ties of the spells\n",
      "\n",
      "that had bound her were undone, and she was dazzled by Taj al-\n",
      "\n",
      "Muluk’s beauty and the symmetry of his form. Passion stirred in her\n",
      "\n",
      "and she said to the old woman: ‘Nurse, this young man is\n",
      "\n",
      "handsome.’ ‘True,’ replied the nurse, and she gestured to Taj al-\n",
      "\n",
      "Muluk to indicate that he should go home. He was on \u0000re with love\n",
      "\n",
      "and his passion and ardour had increased, but he went o\u0000 without\n",
      "\n",
      "stopping and, after saying goodbye to the gardener, he returned\n",
      "\n",
      "home. His longing had been aroused, but he did not disobey the old\n",
      "\n",
      "woman and he told the vizier and ‘Aziz that she had signalled to\n",
      "\n",
      "him to go. They advised him to be patient, telling him that she\n",
      "\n",
      "would not have done that had she not thought that it would be\n",
      "\n",
      "useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much for Taj al-Muluk, the vizier and ‘Aziz, but as for the\n",
      "\n",
      "princess, she was overwhelmed by love, and her passion and ardour\n",
      "\n",
      "increased. She told the old woman: ‘I don’t know how I can meet\n",
      "\n",
      "this young man except with your help.’ ‘I take refuge in God from\n",
      "\n",
      "Satan the accursed,’ said the old woman. ‘You don’t want men, so\n",
      "\n",
      "how have you come to be so disturbed by love for this one,\n",
      "\n",
      "although, by God, he is the only \u0000t mate for your youth?’ ‘Help me,\n",
      "\n",
      "nurse,’ said the princess, ‘and if you can arrange for me to meet him,\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall give you a thousand dinars, while if you don’t, I am sure to\n",
      "\n",
      "die.’ ‘Do you go back to your palace,’ said the old woman, ‘and I\n",

      "shall arrange your meeting and give my life to satisfy the two of\n",
      "\n",
      "you.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Princess Dunya then returned to her palace, while the old woman\n",
      "\n",
      "went to Taj al-Muluk. When he saw her, he jumped to his feet and\n",
      "\n",
      "greeted her with respect and honour and sat her down beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The scheme has worked,’ she said, and she told him what had\n",
      "\n",
      "happened with the princess. ‘When can we meet?’ he asked her, and\n",
      "\n",
      "when she said tomorrow, he gave her a thousand dinars and a robe\n",
      "\n",
      "worth another thousand. She took these and then left, going straight\n",
      "\n",
      "on until she reached the princess. ‘Nurse,’ the princess asked, ‘what\n",
      "\n",
      "news do you have of my beloved?’ ‘I have found where he is,’ she\n",
      "\n",
      "replied, ‘and tomorrow I shall bring him to you.’ In her delight at\n",
      "\n",
      "this, the princess gave her a thousand dinars and a robe worth\n",
      "\n",
      "another thousand. The old woman took these and went o\u0000 to her\n",

      "house, where she spent the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, she went out and set o\u0000 to meet Taj al-Muluk.\n",
      "\n",
      "She dressed him in women’s clothes and told him: ‘Follow behind\n",
      "\n",
      "me; sway as you walk; don’t hurry and pay no attention to anyone\n",
      "\n",
      "who talks to you.’ After giving him these instructions, she went out\n",
      "\n",
      "and he followed behind her in his women’s clothes. All the way\n",
      "\n",
      "along she was telling him what to do and encouraging him to stop\n",
      "\n",
      "him taking fright. She continued to walk on ahead, with him at her\n",
      "\n",
      "heels, until they reached the palace door. She led him in and started\n",
      "\n",
      "to pass through doorways and halls, until she had taken him\n",
      "\n",
      "through seven doors. At the seventh, she said to him: ‘Take heart,\n",

      "and when I shout to you: “Come in, girl,” don’t hang back but hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you get into the hall, look left and you will see a room with\n",

      "door, where you will \u0000nd what you seek.’ ‘And where will you go\n",
      "\n",
      "yourself?’ asked Taj al-Muluk. ‘Nowhere,’ she replied, ‘but I may fall\n",
      "\n",
      "behind you, and if the chief eunuch detains me, I’ll chat with him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked on, followed by Taj al-Muluk, until she came to the\n",
      "\n",
      "door where the chief eunuch was. He saw that she had a\n",
      "\n",
      "companion, this being Taj al-Muluk disguised as a slave girl, and he\n",
      "\n",
      "asked about ‘her’. ‘She is a slave girl. Princess Dunya has heard that\n",
      "\n",
      "she knows how to do various types of work and wants to buy her.’ ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "know nothing about a slave girl or anyone else,’ said the eunuch,\n",

      "‘but no one is going in until I search them, as the king has ordered.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",

      "\n",
      "\u0000fth night, SHE CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that the eunuch said: ‘I know\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing about a slave girl or anyone else, but no one is going in\n",
      "\n",
      "until I search them, as the king has ordered.’ The old woman made a\n",
      "\n",
      "show of anger and said: ‘I know you as a sensible, well-mannered\n",
      "\n",
      "man, but if you have changed, I shall tell the princess and let her\n",
      "\n",
      "know that you have obstructed the arrival of her slave girl.’ She\n",
      "\n",
      "then shouted to Taj al-Muluk and said: ‘Come on, girl,’ at which he\n",
      "\n",
      "came into the hall as she had told him, while the eunuch kept silent\n",
      "\n",
      "and said nothing.\n",

      "Taj al-Muluk counted \u0000ve doors and went in through the sixth,\n",

      "where he found Princess Dunya standing waiting for him. When she\n",
      "\n",
      "saw him, she recognized him and clasped him to her breast, as he\n",
      "\n",
      "clasped her to his. The old woman then came in, having contrived to\n",
      "\n",
      "get rid of the slave girls for fear of exposure. ‘You can act as\n",
      "\n",
      "doorkeeper,’ the princess told her, and she then remained alone\n",
      "\n",
      "with Taj al-Muluk. The two of them continued hugging, embracing\n",
      "\n",
      "and intertwining legs until early dawn. Then, when it was nearly\n",
      "\n",
      "morning, she left him, closing the door on him and going into\n",
      "\n",
      "another room, where she sat down in her usual place. Her slave girls\n",
      "\n",
      "came to her, and after dealing with their a\u0000airs and talking to them,\n",

      "things went on like this for a whole month.\n",

      "Taj al-Muluk. When he saw this, he was at a loss to know what to do\n",

      "‘Kafur, conceal what God has concealed.’ ‘I cannot hide anything\n",

      "herself on him and said to her father: ‘Kill me before you kill him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The king spoke angrily to her and ordered the servants to take her\n",

      "to her room. He then turned to Taj al-Muluk and said: ‘Where have\n",

      "you come from, damn you? Who is your father and how did you\n",
      "\n",
      "dare to approach my daughter?’ Taj al-Muluk said: ‘King, know that\n",
      "\n",
      "if you kill me, you will be destroyed and you and all the inhabitants\n",
      "\n",
      "of your kingdom will have cause for regret.’ When the king asked\n",
      "\n",
      "him why this was, he went on: ‘Know that I am the son of King\n",
      "\n",
      "Sulaiman Shah, and before you know it, he will bring his horse and\n",

      "\n",
      "whether what he said was true, but the vizier said: ‘My advice is\n",
      "\n",
      "that you should kill this scoundrel quickly, for he has the insolence\n",
      "\n",
      "to take liberties with the daughters of kings.’ So the king told the\n",
      "\n",
      "executioner: ‘Cut o\u0000 his head, for he is a traitor.’ The executioner\n",
      "\n",
      "seized Taj al-Muluk and bound him. He then raised his hand, by\n",
      "\n",
      "way of consulting the emirs, \u0000rst once and then again. In doing so,\n",
      "\n",
      "he wanted to delay things, but the king shouted at him: ‘How long\n",
      "\n",
      "are you going to consult? If you do this once more, I shall cut o\u0000\n",
      "\n",
      "your head.’ So the executioner raised his arm until the hair in his\n",

      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",

      "been allowed to say. Then, when it was the one hundred and thirty-\n",

      "sixth night, SHE CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that the executioner raised his\n",

      "\n",
      "strike when suddenly there were loud screams and people shut up\n",
      "\n",
      "their shops. ‘Don’t be too fast,’ the king said to the executioner, and\n",
      "\n",
      "he sent someone to \u0000nd out what was happening. When the man\n",
      "\n",
      "came back, he reported: ‘I have seen an army like a thunderous sea\n",
      "\n",
      "with tumultuous waves. The earth is trembling beneath the hooves\n",
      "\n",
      "of their galloping horses, but I don’t know who they are.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The king was dismayed, fearing that he was going to lose his\n",

      "gone out to meet this army?’ But before he had \u0000nished speaking,\n",
      "\n",
      "his chamberlains entered, escorting messengers from the newly\n",

      "arrived king, among them being Sulaiman Shah’s vizier. The vizier\n",
      "\n",
      "was the \u0000rst to greet the king, who rose to meet the envoys, told\n",
      "\n",
      "them to approach and asked them why they had come. The vizier\n",

      "\n",
      "replied the vizier. ‘He is King Sulaiman Shah, ruler of the Green\n",
      "\n",
      "Land, the Twin Pillars and the mountains of Isfahan. He loves justice\n",
      "\n",
      "and equity, hating injustice and tyranny. His message to you is that\n",
      "\n",
      "his son, who is his darling and the fruit of his heart, is with you and\n",
      "\n",
      "in your city. If the prince is safe, that is what he hopes to \u0000nd, and\n",
      "\n",
      "you will be thanked and praised, but if he has disappeared from\n",
      "\n",
      "your land or if some misfortune has overtaken him, then be assured\n",
      "\n",
      "of ruin and the devastation of your country, for he will make it a\n",

      "\n",
      "came, he told them to go and look for the young man. Taj al-Muluk\n",
      "\n",
      "was still in the hands of the executioner and so afraid had he been\n",
      "\n",
      "that his appearance had changed. His father’s vizier happened to\n",
      "\n",
      "look around and found him lying on the execution mat. On\n",

      "said: ‘My son, do not blame me; do not blame the evil-doer for what\n",
      "\n",
      "he did. Have pity on my white hairs and do not bring destruction on\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Have no fear, sir,’ said the king. ‘Nothing but happiness will come\n",

      "from his master what he had seen. He then ordered his principal\n",

      "\n",
      "opposite her heart. She bent over it, saying: ‘I must kill myself, for I\n",

      "like this, he shouted to her: ‘Mistress of princesses, don’t do it! Have\n",

      "pity on your father and your countrymen!’ He then went up to her\n",

      "dependent on her. She smiled and said: ‘Didn’t I tell you that he was\n",

      "a king’s son? By God, I shall have to let him crucify you on a piece\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The king then hurried away to Taj al-Muluk, to whom he\n",

      "\n",
      "the king went out and shut the door on them with his own hand. He\n",

      "while he himself mounted and rode from the city with his chief\n",

      "delighted to hear the news brought by the vizier and ‘Aziz, and he\n",
      "\n",
      "exclaimed: ‘Praise be to God who has allowed my son to achieve his\n",

      "him on his couch, where they talked together happily. Food was\n",

      "produced and they ate their \u0000ll, after which they moved on to\n",

      "sweetmeats and fruit, both fresh and dried, all of which they\n",

      "went in, he found that she had undone her hair, which was spread\n",

      "I show patience in the face of each disaster,\n",

      "Makan laughed at this and the vizier Dandan went up to him and\n",
      "\n",
      "explained the story. ‘He was your brother and your companion, and\n",

      "be,’ Dau’ al-Makan assured him, but he repeated: ‘I’m afraid lest I\n",
      "\n",
      "ask for something and you don’t give it to me.’ The king laughed\n",

      "and said: ‘If you asked for half my kingdom I would share it with\n",

      "you. So say what you want, with no more prevarication.’ Again the\n",

      "\n",
      "decree for me putting me in charge of all the furnace men in\n",

      "there. ‘Make another wish,’ he said. ‘Didn’t I tell you, sir,’ said the\n",

      "\n",
      "or couldn’t give me?’ The vizier prodded him again and then again,\n",
      "\n",
      "and on each occasion he said: ‘I have a wish to make.’ ‘Say what you\n",

      "nothing wrong. It was you who told me to ask for something big.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he added: ‘Let me go back home.’\n",

      "\n",
      "granted your request,’ said the king, at which the man kissed the\n",

      "gave him a robe of o\u0000ce and wrote and signed a decree of\n",

      "whose story is like mine, for I, too, have been travelling for twenty\n",
      "\n",
      "days without seeing or hearing anyone.’ He decided not to reply\n",
      "\n",
      "until day had broken, and so he stayed silent. The reciter shouted to\n",
      "\n",
      "him: ‘You who called, if you are a jinni, go o\u0000 in peace, but if you\n",
      "\n",
      "are human, stay awhile until dawn comes and the darkness of night\n",

      "\n",
      "shedding copious tears until night ended and the light of dawn\n",

      "appeared.\n",

      "young Bedouin wearing tattered clothes, girt with a sword that had\n",
      "\n",
      "rusted in its scabbard, and marked out as a lover. He went up and\n",

      "greeted him, and the Bedouin returned his greeting, saluting him\n",
      "\n",
      "courteously, although, in fact, he despised him, seeing him to be\n",
      "\n",
      "both young and impoverished. ‘Young man,’ he said, ‘to what people\n",
      "\n",
      "do you belong; what is your clan and what is your story? You travel\n",
      "\n",
      "by night, the action of a hero, and what you said to me at night\n",

      "you.’ ‘Look out, here it is,’ said Sabbah, throwing him the shield. He\n",
      "\n",
      "then drew his sword and attacked Kana-ma-Kana, who took the\n",

      "out in distress: ‘Don’t do this, champion of the age. Let me go and\n",

      "make me one of your servants.’ In tears, he then recited these lines:\n",

      "\n",
      "every noble quality and indescribable grace, so as to distract all\n",

      "men’s hearts. The riders of her clan and the champions of that\n",

      "to marry or to give herself to any man who could not defeat her.\n",

      "Kahardash was one of her suitors, but she had told her father that\n",

      "better of her in a duel.\n",

      "refused and would not \u0000ght, and he had continued in his refusal\n",
      "\n",
      "until his encounter with Kana-ma-Kana. He was taken aback,\n",

      "courage. Advancing towards Kana-ma-Kana, he said: ‘Damn you,\n",

      "what you suspect her to be, and come out to \u0000ght. You will soon be\n",
      "\n",
      "on the ground.’ He then began to wheel and attack, varying his\n",
      "\n",
      "tactics so that when Kahardash saw this, he realized that here was a\n",
      "\n",
      "gallant rider and a lion-like champion. His mistake was made clear\n",
      "\n",
      "to him when he saw the dark down on Kana-ma-Kana’s cheek, like\n",
      "\n",
      "myrtle growing among red roses. He shrank from his attack and said\n",
      "\n",
      "to his companions: ‘Damn you, charge him, one of you, and show\n",
      "\n",
      "him the sharp sword and the quivering lance. You should know that\n",

      "\n",
      "At that, a strong rider charged Kana-ma-Kana, mounted on a\n",

      "\n",
      "its forehead, bewildering both mind and eye, like ‘Antar’s Abjar, of\n",

      "\n",
      "each other, striking blows that bewildered the mind and blinded the\n",
      "\n",
      "eye. Kana-ma-Kana then forestalled him with the blow of a\n",
      "\n",
      "champion that cut through his turban and his head-piece until it\n",
      "\n",
      "reached the head itself, at which he toppled to the ground like a\n",
      "\n",
      "falling camel. A second rider charged, then a third, a fourth and a\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000fth, only to fall as the \u0000rst had done. All the rest then attacked,\n",
      "\n",
      "upset and burning with anger, but his spear soon picked them o\u0000\n",
      "\n",
      "like ripe fruit. When Kahardash saw this, he was afraid to enter the\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000ght, realizing that Kana-ma-Kana was a stout-hearted warrior, \u0000t\n",
      "\n",
      "to be considered unique among champions. So he said to him: ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "grant you your own life and shall not take blood revenge for my\n",

      "companions. Take what \u0000ocks you like and go on your way. I feel\n",

      "to one side and the other was that it had fawns, and so I let it go\n",

      "and I let the others go for its sake.’ ‘Let me go too,’ said Sabbah, ‘so\n",

      "he will soon be dead.’ ‘Where is he being held?’ asked Kana-ma-\n",
      "\n",
      "Kana. ‘In that tall dome,’ said the young man. Kana-ma-Kana looked\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the dome and saw people going in and striking Sasan, who\n",
      "\n",
      "was enduring the pains of death. He got up and went to the dome\n",

      "one body longed for the other. No one at that time could talk of\n",

      "the bravest champion of the age. ‘No one else should be our ruler,’\n",

      "\n",
      "Qudiya-fa-Kana, to Kana-ma-Kana, and you should listen to what\n",

      "When Sasan heard what she had to say and grasped the point of\n",
      "\n",
      "the poem, he left her in anger, saying: ‘Were it not a matter of\n",
      "\n",
      "disgrace to kill you, I would cut o\u0000 your head with my sword and\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "hands. ‘You are right,’ she added, ‘and you and I will think of some\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Do it quickly and relieve my worry, as, for my part, I cannot think\n",
      "\n",
      "of a plan.’ ‘I shall work out a way,’ she assured him, and when he\n",
      "\n",
      "asked how, she said: ‘By means of my servant, Bakun, who is a\n",

      "proli\u0000c schemer.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Bakun was one of the most ill-omened of old women, who held\n",
      "\n",
      "that it was not permissible to abandon wickedness. She had brought\n",
      "\n",
      "up Kana-ma-Kana and Qudiya-fa-Kana, Kana-ma-Kana being\n",
      "\n",
      "particularly fond of her, as a result of which he used to sleep at her\n",

      "feet. When Sasan heard what his wife had to say, he approved of her\n",
      "\n",
      "proposal and, having summoned Bakun, he told her what had\n",
      "\n",
      "happened and ordered her to try to kill Kana-ma-Kana, promising\n",

      "her favours of all kinds. ‘Your orders are to be obeyed,’ she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Master, I want you to give me a lethal dagger so that I may kill him\n",
      "\n",
      "quickly for you.’ Sasan welcomed her agreement and produced for\n",
      "\n",
      "her a dagger that could almost forestall fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bakun had heard stories and poems and had a repertoire of\n",
      "\n",
      "anecdotes and tales. After taking the dagger, she left the apartment,\n",
      "\n",
      "thinking about how to destroy Kana-ma-Kana. She went to him as\n",

      "of her that night, his heart was on \u0000re with love. While he was in\n",
      "\n",
      "this state, Bakun came in to visit him, saying: ‘The time of union is\n",
      "\n",
      "at hand and the days of separation are over.’ When he heard this, he\n",
      "\n",
      "asked her how Qudiya-fa-Kana was and Bakun replied: ‘She is\n",
      "\n",
      "preoccupied by love for you.’ Kana-ma-Kana rose and put his own\n",
      "\n",
      "robes on her, promising her favours of all kinds. She said: ‘Know\n",
      "\n",
      "that I shall sleep in your room tonight and tell you things that I\n",

      "have heard, diverting you with tales of infatuated lovers, sick with\n",

      "him with the dagger hidden in her clothes, SHE CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "Know, O prince, that the pleasantest tale that I ever heard goes as\n",
      "\n",
      "follows. A certain man used to love pretty women, on whom he\n",
      "\n",
      "spent his money, until he had lost everything and was reduced to\n",
      "\n",
      "poverty. In his destitution he started to wander through the markets,\n",
      "\n",
      "looking for something on which to feed himself. While he was\n",
      "\n",
      "walking, a nail pierced his toe, drawing blood. He sat down, wiped\n",
      "\n",
      "o\u0000 the blood and bandaged his toe, after which he got up, crying\n",
      "\n",
      "out in pain. Passing by a bath house, he went in and took o\u0000 his\n",
      "\n",
      "clothes. On entering he found the place clean and so he sat by the\n",
      "\n",
      "fountain and kept on pouring water over his head until he grew\n",
      "\n",
      "tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",
      "\n",
      "been allowed to say. Then, when it was the hundred and forty-third\n",
      "\n",
      "night, SHE CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that the man sat by the fountain\n",
      "\n",
      "and kept on pouring water over his head until he grew tired. He\n",
      "\n",
      "then went to the cold-water room, where he found himself alone\n",
      "\n",
      "with no companions. Taking out a piece of hashish, he swallowed it,\n",
      "\n",
      "and as the drug went to his head he toppled over on to the marble\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000oor. The hashish led him to imagine that a high functionary was\n",
      "\n",
      "massaging him, while two slaves stood at his head, one with a bowl\n",
      "\n",
      "and the other with the utensils needed for washing in the baths.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he saw that, he said to himself: ‘Either these people have\n",
      "\n",
      "mistaken who I am or else they are hashish eaters like me.’ He\n",
      "\n",
      "stretched out his legs and in his delusion he thought that the bath\n",
      "\n",
      "man said to him: ‘It’s time for you to go up, for you are on duty\n",
      "\n",
      "today.’ ‘Well done, hashish,’ he said to himself, laughing, and he sat\n",
      "\n",
      "there in silence. The bath man got up, took him by the hand and\n",
      "\n",
      "wrapped a band of black silk around his waist. The two slaves\n",
      "\n",
      "walked behind him with the bowl and utensils until they brought\n",
      "\n",
      "him to a private room, where they released perfumes into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found the room full of fruits and scented \u0000owers. The servants\n",
      "\n",
      "sliced a melon for him and sat him on an ebony chair, while the\n",
      "\n",
      "bath man stood washing him as the servants poured out the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "They rubbed him down expertly, saying: ‘Our lord and master, may\n",
      "\n",
      "you enjoy constant happiness.’ They then went out, closing the door\n",
      "\n",
      "on him, and when he imagined that, he got up, removed the band\n",
      "\n",
      "from his waist and started to laugh until he almost lost\n",
      "\n",
      "consciousness. He went on laughing for a while and then said to\n",
      "\n",
      "himself: ‘I wonder why they were addressing me as though I were a\n",
      "\n",
      "vizier, calling me “lord and master”. It may be that they have got\n",
      "\n",
      "things wrong for the moment but afterwards they will recognize\n",
      "\n",
      "who I am and say: “This is a good-for-nothing” and beat me on the\n",

      "neck to their hearts’ content.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding the room too hot, he opened the door and, in his dream,\n",
      "\n",
      "he saw a small mamluk and a eunuch coming in. The mamluk had\n",
      "\n",
      "with him a package which he opened and out of which he took\n",
      "\n",
      "three silk towels, placing one on the man’s head, the second over his\n",
      "\n",
      "shoulders and the third round his waist. The eunuch gave him clogs,\n",
      "\n",
      "which he put on, and then other mamluks and eunuchs came up to\n",
      "\n",
      "him and supported him as he left the room, laughing, and went to\n",
      "\n",
      "the hall, which was sumptuously furnished in a way suitable only\n",
      "\n",
      "for kings. Servants hurried up to him and sat him on a dais, where\n",
      "\n",
      "they started to massage him until he fell asleep. In his sleep, he\n",
      "\n",
      "dreamt that there was a girl on his lap. He kissed her and placed her\n",
      "\n",
      "between his thighs, sitting with her as a man does with a woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking his penis in his hand and drawing the girl to him, he pressed\n",
      "\n",
      "her beneath him.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point, someone called out: ‘Wake up, you good-for-\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing! It’s noon and you’re still asleep.’ He opened his eyes and\n",
      "\n",
      "found himself in the cold-water room surrounded by a crowd of\n",
      "\n",
      "people who were laughing at him. He had an erection and the towel\n",
      "\n",
      "had slipped from his waist. He realized, to his sorrow, that all this\n",
      "\n",
      "had been a drug-induced fantasy, and turning to the man who had\n",
      "\n",
      "woken him, he said: ‘You could have waited until I put it in.’ ‘Aren’t\n",
      "\n",
      "you ashamed, hashish eater,’ the people said, ‘to sleep with your\n",
      "\n",
      "penis erect?’ Then they slapped him until the back of his neck was\n",
      "\n",
      "red. He was hungry but in his dream he had tasted happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Kana-ma-Kana heard this story from Bakun, he laughed until\n",

      "\n",
      "continued to tell him witty tales and amusing anecdotes until he\n",
      "\n",
      "was overcome by sleep. Bakun stayed sitting by his head until most\n",
      "\n",
      "of the night had gone. ‘This is the time to seize the opportunity,’ she\n",

      "said to herself. Standing up, she drew the dagger, leapt at Kana-ma-\n",

      "started to tremble as though she was in the grip of a fever. This\n",
      "\n",
      "surprised Kana-ma-Kana’s mother, who roused her son, and when he\n",

      "\n",
      "Know, peahen, that I have lived all my life in safety on this island\n",

      "without seeing anything unpleasant. Then, one night as I slept, a son\n",
      "\n",
      "of Adam appeared to me in a dream and spoke to me and I spoke to\n",

      "him. I heard a voice saying: ‘Duck, beware of the son of Adam!\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t be deceived by what he says or by what he suggests to you,\n",
      "\n",
      "for he is full of wiles and trickery. Beware, beware of his guile, for\n",

      "he is a deceiver and a trickster, as the poet says:\n",

      "down elephants with his cunning. Nothing is safe from the evil that\n",
      "\n",
      "he does and neither bird nor beast can escape from him. I have now\n",

      "been able to relax for fear of the son of Adam, lest he surprise me by\n",

      "means of some trick and catch me in his nets. By the end of the day,\n",
      "\n",
      "my strength had weakened and my spirits had failed. I wanted to eat\n",
      "\n",
      "and drink and so I went away, troubled and gloomy, and reached a\n",
      "\n",
      "mountain, where at the entrance of a cave I found a tawny lion cub\n",
      "\n",
      "who was delighted to see me, admiring my colour and my delicate\n",
      "\n",
      "shape. He called out to me and told me to come up to him. When I\n",
      "\n",
      "did, he asked me my name and what kind of creature I was. ‘My\n",
      "\n",
      "name is Duck,’ I replied, ‘and I am a bird.’ Then I asked why he kept\n",
      "\n",
      "on sitting there, and he said: ‘The reason is that my father, the lion,\n",
      "\n",
      "has been warning me for days about the son of Adam, and last night\n",
      "\n",
      "in a dream this son of Adam appeared to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The lion cub then told me the same story that I have told you,\n",

      "\n",
      "\u0000lled me with great fear for my life, and I am even more afraid\n",
      "\n",
      "because you are afraid of him, although you are the king of the\n",

      "the son of Adam, advising him to kill him, until he suddenly got up\n",
      "\n",
      "and walked o\u0000 with me following behind him, as he lashed his back\n",
      "\n",
      "with his tail. We went on until we came to a fork in the road and we\n",
      "\n",
      "saw rising dust which cleared away to show beneath it a stray\n",

      "donkey, with no trappings, galloping and running at times and at\n",

      "him and the donkey came up submissively. ‘You feeble-witted\n",

      "\n",
      "donkey is to be excused, and what he said has made me even more\n",
      "\n",
      "afraid.’ The lion cub then asked the donkey where he was going,\n",

      "\n",
      "of endurance, and had I not seen you here, I would not have done\n",

      "this.’ The peahen said: ‘We have to ful\u0000l whatever destiny is written\n",

      "against which you were on your guard is a gazelle, and here it is,\n",

      "\n",
      "came to this island today and I have never seen a more fertile spot,\n",
      "\n",
      "or a better place in which to live.’ It then asked them to take it as a\n",

      "true friend, and when the two companions saw how well disposed it\n",
      "\n",
      "was to them, they approached it, being eager for its companionship,\n",
      "\n",
      "and all three took vows of friendship. They started to pass the night\n",

      "in the same spot and ate and drank together, and they continued\n",

      "\n",
      "peahen went up into its tree and then \u0000ew o\u0000 into the air, while the\n",

      "confused to move and was caught. She cried out: ‘Caution has not\n",
      "\n",
      "helped me against my destined fate,’ and the sailors took her o\u0000 to\n",
      "\n",
      "their ship. When the peahen saw what had happened to the duck,\n",
      "\n",
      "she left the island. ‘I see that disasters are on the lookout for every\n",
      "\n",
      "one of us,’ she said, adding: ‘Had it not been for this ship, I would\n",
      "\n",
      "not have been parted from this duck, one of the best of my friends.’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "May God cut in pieces the heart of that same day.\n",

      "I wish that union might return one day,\n",
      "\n",
      "So I could tell the beloved what separation did.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gazelle was exceedingly distressed, but it persuaded the\n",

      "\n",
      "gazelle, eating and drinking in safety, although both were still\n",
      "\n",
      "grieved by the loss of the duck. The gazelle then said to the peahen:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You know, sister, that the sailors who came to us from the ship\n",
      "\n",
      "were the cause of our separation and of the death of the duck, so\n",
      "\n",
      "beware of this and guard against them and against the treacherous\n",
      "\n",
      "wiles of the sons of Adam.’ ‘I know for a fact,’ replied the peahen,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘that what killed the duck was that she gave up saying: “Glory be to\n",
      "\n",
      "God.” I had told her that I was afraid for her because of this, as all\n",
      "\n",
      "God’s creation must glorify Him and whoever neglects this is\n",
      "\n",
      "punished by destruction.’ When the gazelle heard this, it said to the\n",
      "\n",
      "peahen: ‘May God beautify you,’ and it set about praising God\n",
      "\n",
      "continuously. The formula of praise used by the gazelle was said to\n",

      "prayed that the pair might have many young and the prayer was\n",
      "\n",
      "answered. The hermit’s mountain was the only place to which the\n",

      "pigeons went, and the reason that they associated with him was the\n",
      "\n",
      "frequency with which they glori\u0000ed God. It is said that the formula\n",
      "\n",
      "of praise used by pigeons was: ‘Glory be to the Author of all\n",

      "It is told that on a certain mountain there was a shepherd – a\n",

      "\n",
      "bene\u0000ting from their milk and their wool. His mountain was\n",

      "covered in trees and pastures and there were many beasts of prey,\n",
      "\n",
      "but no wild beast had any power over him or over his \u0000ocks. He\n",

      "lived a peaceful life there, una\u0000ected by worldly matters because of\n",

      "\n",
      "God had decreed, he became very ill and went into a mountain cave\n",
      "\n",
      "from which his \u0000ock used to go out by day to their pasture,\n",
      "\n",
      "returning to it for shelter at night. Almighty God, wishing to test\n",

      "him and to try out his obedience and his powers of endurance, sent\n",

      "down an angel, who sat down in front of him in the form of a\n",

      "\n",
      "and I will have nothing to do with what you are showing me. You\n",

      "are deceitful and treacherous, faithful to no covenant. How much\n",

      "\n",
      "I have heard that in a certain village there was a weaver who\n",
      "\n",
      "could only make a livelihood by working very hard indeed. It\n",
      "\n",
      "happened that a rich man in the neighbourhood gave a feast to\n",
      "\n",
      "which he invited everybody. The weaver went along and saw\n",
      "\n",
      "magni\u0000cently dressed people receiving \u0000ne foods and being treated\n",
      "\n",
      "with respect by the host because of their splendid clothes. He said to\n",
      "\n",
      "himself: ‘Were I to change my trade for one that would be of less\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble, more prestigious and more rewarding, I could collect a lot\n",
      "\n",
      "of money and buy clothes like these. I would then become\n",
      "\n",
      "important; people would respect me and I would be like these\n",
      "\n",
      "others.’ He looked at one of the tumblers who was at the banquet.\n",
      "\n",
      "This man got up and climbed on to a very high wall from which he\n",
      "\n",
      "threw himself down to the ground, after which he got up on his feet\n",
      "\n",
      "again. The weaver said to himself: ‘I must do the same thing; it is\n",
      "\n",
      "not beyond my powers.’ So he got up on the wall and threw himself\n",
      "\n",
      "down, but when he reached the ground, he broke his neck and died\n",
      "\n",
      "on the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I tell you this,’ the woman went on, ‘so that you may make your\n",

      "living from what you are familiar with and know, lest you become\n",
      "\n",
      "greedy and become attracted to what is no business of yours.’ Her\n",

      "\n",
      "about them and has no knowledge of how they behave may get the\n",
      "\n",
      "better of them.’ He refused to listen to his wife, bought the goods\n",

      "under suspicion and perished.\n",

      "In those days, there was a sparrow who used to go every day to one\n",

      "of the kings of the birds. He stayed with him morning and evening,\n",
      "\n",
      "as the \u0000rst to visit and the last to leave. As it happened, a group of\n",
      "\n",
      "birds gathered on a high mountain. They said to one another: ‘There\n",
      "\n",
      "are a lot of us and there are many disagreements between us. We\n",
      "\n",
      "must have a king who can look after our a\u0000airs, so that we can all\n",
      "\n",
      "be united and our di\u0000erences may be removed.’ The sparrow, who\n",
      "\n",
      "happened to pass by, advised them to choose the peacock as their\n",
      "\n",
      "king, this being the sovereign whom he was in the habit of visiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The birds did this and made the peacock their ruler. He treated\n",

      "them well and made the sparrow his secretary and vizier. At times,\n",
      "\n",
      "the sparrow would interrupt his attendance on the peacock to\n",
      "\n",
      "oversee a\u0000airs, and one day, when he was absent, the peacock\n",
      "\n",
      "became very concerned. While he was in this state, the sparrow\n",
      "\n",
      "came in and the peacock asked him: ‘What delayed you, who are the\n",
      "\n",
      "closest of my followers to me and the dearest of them?’ ‘I saw\n",
      "\n",
      "something suspicious which frightened me,’ answered the sparrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the peacock asked him what this was, the sparrow explained:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I saw a man with a net who spread it out by my nest, fastening it\n",
      "\n",
      "with pegs and scattering grain in the middle of it. I sat to watch\n",
      "\n",
      "what he was going to do and while I was there, fate brought a crane\n",
      "\n",
      "and his mate who fell into the middle of the net. They began to cry\n",
      "\n",
      "out and the hunter got up and caught them. This disturbed me; it is\n",
      "\n",
      "why I did not come to you, king of the age, and I shall not go on\n",
      "\n",
      "living in this nest for fear of the net.’ ‘Don’t leave this place,’ said\n",
      "\n",
      "the peacock, ‘for caution will not help you against fate.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The sparrow did what he was told, saying: ‘I shall be patient and\n",
      "\n",
      "not leave, out of obedience to the king.’ He went on acting\n",
      "\n",
      "cautiously, and he brought food to the peacock, who would eat his\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000ll and wash down the food with a drink of water, after which the\n",
      "\n",
      "sparrow would \u0000y o\u0000. One day, while he was watching, he saw two\n",

      "other sparrows \u0000ghting on the ground. ‘How is it,’ he said to\n",
      "\n",
      "himself, ‘that I am the king’s vizier and here are two sparrows\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000ghting in my presence before my eyes? By God, I shall act as a\n",
      "\n",
      "peacemaker between them.’ He went to them in order to do that,\n",
      "\n",
      "but the hunter tossed up the net over the three of them and the\n",
      "\n",
      "sparrow fell into the middle of it. The hunter came up, took him and\n",
      "\n",
      "handed him to his companion, saying: ‘Keep a good hold of this one,\n",
      "\n",
      "for it is plump and I have never seen a \u0000ner sparrow.’ The sparrow\n",
      "\n",
      "said to himself: ‘I have fallen into the trap that I feared. It was the\n",
      "\n",
      "peacock who reassured me, but caution does not help against the\n",
      "\n",
      "blows of fate. The prudent man cannot escape his destiny. How well\n",

      "has the poet put it:\n",
      "\n",
      "What is not to be cannot be brought about by any plan,\n",

      "While that which is to be will be.\n",

      "caliphate of Harun al-Rashid, there was a merchant who had a son\n",
      "\n",
      "named Abu’l-Hasan ‘Ali ibn Tahir. The father was extremely rich\n",
      "\n",

      "without asking permission and he was a favourite with all the\n",

      "and stirrups of gold. She was wearing a delicate veil and round her\n",

      "\n",
      "So much for her, but as for ‘Ali ibn Bakkar, he did not know what\n",
      "\n",
      "to say. Then, some time later, the maid came to Abu’l-Hasan and\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "kinds of furnishings and embellished with every sort of ornament,\n",
      "\n",
      "like one of the chambers of Paradise, where they were astonished by\n",

      "dressed in a blue robe, with a veil of silk embroidered with gold and\n",

      "on a couch.\n",

      "kind had you told me about this before we came in here, so that I\n",
      "\n",
      "might have prepared myself and summoned up endurance to face it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He then wept, moaned and complained, and Abu’l-Hasan said to\n",

      "for she looks on you with favour and wants to meet you.’ ‘What is\n",

      "her name?’ asked ‘Ali. ‘Shams al-Nahar,’ answered Abu’l-Hasan. ‘She\n",

      "\n",
      "opposite a window. She told them to sing, at which one of them\n",
      "\n",
      "took a lute and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Take back the message again and bring a clear reply:\n",

      "The glance of the beloved and not wine has made me drunk;\n",

      "\n",
      "the strings, she recited these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncommon tears clash on his cheeks,\n",
      "\n",

      "the hall door was shut and she herself went out by her private door\n",

      "to the garden, where she sat on a couch that she had there. One girl\n",
      "\n",
      "was to massage her feet while the others were to return to their\n",

      "turned to one of the slave girls and said: ‘Gharam, produce what you\n",
      "\n",
      "have in the way of delightful song.’ The girl took her lute and,\n",
      "\n",
      "having tuned it, she recited:\n",

      "There is a Bedouin girl whose clan have gone;\n",

      "from the balcony, he, too, fainted, prompting Abu’l-Hasan to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fate has divided love equally between you.’ While this was going\n",
      "\n",
      "on, the girl who had brought them to the balcony came back and\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘Get up, Abu’l-Hasan, you and your friend, and go down. We\n",
      "\n",
      "are in a dangerous place and I’m afraid that we may be found out or\n",
      "\n",
      "that the caliph come to know about you. If you don’t go down\n",
      "\n",
      "straight away, we are dead.’ ‘How can this young man get up and go\n",
      "\n",
      "with me?’ asked Abu’l-Hasan, ‘when he has not even got the\n",

      "strength to rise?’ The girl started to sprinkle him with rosewater\n",
      "\n",
      "until he had recovered his senses, at which Abu’l-Hasan lifted him\n",

      "\n",
      "Abu’l-Hasan’s friend was a jeweller and when the girl had gone,\n",

      "\n",
      "brought me a note saying that she wanted a jewelled necklace and I\n",
      "\n",
      "sent her one of great value.’ When ‘Ali heard this, he was disturbed\n",
      "\n",
      "that his life was in danger, but, recovering his composure, he said:\n",

      "of the whole a\u0000air on condition that you tell me what is really\n",
      "\n",
      "wrong with you and what is the cause of your illness.’ So ‘Ali told\n",

      "\n",
      "everyone except you, my brother, for fear lest people uncover the\n",

      "you,’ said the jeweller, ‘was because of my a\u0000ection for you and my\n",

      "suspicious as she went o\u0000 to her mistress, since she had a fondness\n",

      "you to get what you want.’ ‘Who is able to do that,’ asked ‘Ali, ‘and\n",

      "\n",
      "in a panic, just as the slave girl was saying: ‘Disaster has overtaken\n",

      "‘What has happened is what Abu’l-Hasan feared. He went o\u0000 to\n",

      "Basra and it is I who have fallen into the trap.’ Word of the\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "him from all sides, some taking malicious pleasure in his misfortune,\n",
      "\n",
      "while others were helpful and sympathetic. He poured out his\n",

      "complaints to them and would neither eat nor drink because of his\n",
      "\n",
      "distress. Then, while he was sitting sorrowfully, one of his servants\n",
      "\n",
      "came in and told him that there was a man at the door asking for\n",
      "\n",
      "him. The jeweller went out to greet him and found someone\n",
      "\n",
      "unknown to him, who told him that he had something to say to him\n",
      "\n",
      "in private. The jeweller took him into his house, where he asked\n",
      "\n",
      "what he had to say. ‘Go with me to your second house,’ said the\n",
      "\n",
      "man. ‘Do you know my second house?’ asked the jeweller. The man\n",

      "dispel your cares.’ THE JEWELLER WENT ON:\n",
      "\n",
      "I told myself that I had better do what he wanted, and so I\n",
      "\n",
      "accompanied him to the house. When he saw it, he said: ‘There is\n",
      "\n",
      "neither door nor doorman here. We can’t sit in this place, so take me\n",
      "\n",
      "somewhere else.’ I stayed with him as he went round from one place\n",
      "\n",
      "to another, until night fell and I had still not asked him any\n",
      "\n",
      "questions. He kept on walking with me until we came out into open\n",

      "country. ‘Follow me,’ he said, and he started to walk faster, with me\n",
      "\n",
      "hurrying behind him, encouraging myself to carry on. We then got\n",
      "\n",
      "to the river, where we were met by a small boat, and the boatman\n",

      "with him, after which he fastened the door with an iron lock. He\n",
      "\n",
      "then brought me into a hall and I was confronted by ten men who\n",
      "\n",
      "looked so similar that they seemed to be one and the same person.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were, in fact, brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We exchanged greetings and they told us to sit down, which we\n",

      "did. I was almost dead with tiredness and so they brought me\n",
      "\n",
      "rosewater which they sprinkled on my face. They then poured me\n",
      "\n",
      "wine and fetched food, which some of them ate with me. ‘If there\n",

      "\n",
      "not share it with me.’ When we had washed our hands, they each\n",
      "\n",
      "went back to their places, after which they asked whether I\n",

      "recognized them. ‘No,’ I said, ‘I have never seen you in my life; I\n",
      "\n",
      "have never seen the man who brought me to you, and I have never\n",
      "\n",
      "seen this place.’ ‘Tell us about yourself and without lying,’ they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You must know,’ I replied, ‘that my case is strange and remarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know anything about me?’ ‘Yes,’ they said. ‘It was we who\n",
      "\n",
      "took your goods last night, and we also took your friend and the girl\n",
      "\n",
      "who was singing with him.’ ‘May God protect you,’ I said. ‘Where is\n",
      "\n",
      "my friend and where is the singer?’ ‘Here,’ they said, pointing in a\n",
      "\n",
      "certain direction and adding: ‘But, by God, brother, you are the only\n",
      "\n",
      "one who knows their secret. Since we brought them here, none of us\n",
      "\n",
      "have been to see them and we have not asked them about\n",
      "\n",
      "themselves, because we saw that they had an aura of dignity about\n",
      "\n",
      "them, which is what stopped us from killing them. Tell us the truth\n",
      "\n",
      "about them and we shall spare your life and theirs.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When I heard this, I almost died of fear and I said to them:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Brothers, if chivalry were lost, you can be sure that it is only with\n",
      "\n",
      "you that it would be found. If I had a secret which I was afraid to\n",
      "\n",
      "make known, it is in your hearts that it would be hidden.’ I went on\n",
      "\n",
      "in this exaggerated way, and then I thought that it would be better\n",
      "\n",
      "and more useful to come out with the story rather than to conceal it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I told them everything that had happened to me, from start to\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000nish. They listened to my tale and then asked: ‘Is this young man\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ali ibn Bakkar and is the girl Shams al-Nahar?’ When I said yes,\n",
      "\n",
      "they were taken aback and went and apologized to the pair. ‘Some\n",
      "\n",
      "of what we took from your house has gone, but here is the rest of it,’\n",
      "\n",
      "they said, and they returned most of my belongings, guaranteeing to\n",
      "\n",
      "bring them back to their place in my house and to restore all the\n",
      "\n",
      "rest. My fears were laid to rest, but the ten then split into two\n",
      "\n",
      "groups, one on my side and the other against me. It was then that\n",
      "\n",
      "we left the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "So much for me, but as for ‘Ali and Shams al-Nahar, they had\n",
      "\n",
      "almost died of fear before I approached them and greeted them. I\n",
      "\n",
      "asked them: ‘What do you suppose has happened to the slave girl\n",
      "\n",
      "and the two maids? Where did they go?’ But they said that they\n",
      "\n",
      "knew nothing about them. We then went to where a boat was\n",
      "\n",
      "anchored, and when our escort put us on board, this turned out to\n",
      "\n",
      "be the same one on which I had crossed earlier. The boatman rowed\n",
      "\n",
      "us across to the other side, where we were made to disembark, but\n",
      "\n",
      "before we had time to sit down and rest on the bank, we found\n",
      "\n",
      "ourselves encircled by horsemen who swooped down on all sides\n",
      "\n",
      "like eagles. The men who had brought us hurried to their feet; the\n",

      "lead by its reins. One trooper did the same for ‘Ali and another for\n",

      "\n",
      "where he called out in a foreign language, and a number of people\n",

      "came up from the land side, bringing two boats. We were then\n",

      "containing clothes, which we put on, and strips of muslin which we\n",
      "\n",
      "used as turbans. When we had sat down, a slave girl brought in a\n",
      "\n",
      "table of food which she put in front of us, telling us to eat. We ate a\n",

      "came, he made preparations for the funeral; the corpse was washed,\n",

      "king called Shahriman. He had a large army, together with servants\n",
      "\n",
      "and guards, but he was an old man whose strength was fading and\n",
      "\n",
      "he had no son. This caused him concern and, in his sorrow and\n",

      "anxiety, he complained to one of his viziers, to whom he said: ‘I fear\n",
      "\n",
      "that on my death the kingdom will be ruined as I have no son to\n",
      "\n",
      "succeed me on the throne.’ The vizier replied: ‘It may be that God\n",

      "will yet bring something about, so entrust your a\u0000air to Him, O\n",
      "\n",
      "king, and address your prayers to Him.’ The king got up, performed\n",
      "\n",
      "the ritual ablution and two rak‘as, and invoked God in all sincerity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then called his wife to bed and lay with her immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the power of Almighty God she conceived, and at the end\n",
      "\n",
      "of her months of pregnancy she gave birth to a boy, like the moon\n",

      "The child was provided with nurses, wet and dry, and brought up\n",

      "the king’s orders, Qamar al-Zaman was brought in, bowing his head\n",

      "\n",
      "I have found much that has been written and said about their guile\n",

      "When he had \u0000nished, he went on: ‘Father, to marry is something\n",

      "matter of his marriage. Because he loved him so dearly, however, he\n",

      "mankind; every breeze carried news of his grace; while his beauty\n",
      "\n",
      "was a seduction for lovers and a garden of perfection for the\n",

      "desirous. His speech was sweet; his face put the full moon to shame;\n",
      "\n",
      "the symmetry of his form, his elegance and charm made him\n",

      "resemble the branch of a ban tree or a bamboo shoot; his cheek\n",

      "towards the ground, not knowing, in his astonishment, what to do.\n",

      "close to its destination. Just then, however, when all that it had to\n",

      "seated at a window overlooking the sea. She saw the ship, which\n",

      "had anchored o\u0000 the coast, and, with a palpitating heart,\n",
      "\n",
      "accompanied by her emirs, chamberlains and deputies, she rode\n",
      "\n",
      "down to the shore and halted beside the ship, whose cargo was\n",

      "\n",
      "he told her: ‘Your majesty, I have aromatics, cosmetics, medicinal\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Budur heard him mention the olives, she felt a craving for them and\n",

      "with us, the king can take as many as he wants of them.’ ‘Bring\n",
      "\n",
      "them ashore for me to look at them,’ Budur told him. The captain\n",
      "\n",
      "then shouted to his men, who brought up the \u0000fty containers. Budur\n",
      "\n",
      "opened one, saw the olives and said: ‘I’ll take all \u0000fty and pay you\n",

      "whatever their price may be.’ ‘In our country, they are valueless,’\n",

      "That evening, she had one of the containers brought to her when\n",

      "she was alone in her room with Hayat al-Nufus. She put a dish down\n",
      "\n",
      "in front of her and emptied out the container on to it. When a pile\n",
      "\n",
      "of red gold fell into the plate, she exclaimed to Hayat al-Nufus: ‘This\n",

      "is gold!’ She then had the other containers fetched and, on\n",
      "\n",
      "investigating them, she found that they were all full of gold, with\n",

      "not as many olives as would \u0000ll a single one of them. Then,\n",
      "\n",

      "had been fastened to the waistband of her drawers and which\n",
      "\n",
      "Qamar al-Zaman had taken. When she had made sure of this, she\n",

      "gave a cry of joy and then fell down in a faint.\n",

      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that when Budur saw the ring,\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The next morning, she took her seat on the royal throne and had\n",
      "\n",
      "the ship’s captain brought to her. When he arrived, he kissed the\n",

      "owner of the olives. ‘King of the age,’ he replied, ‘we left him in the\n",
      "\n",
      "land of the Magians, where he looks after an orchard.’ ‘Bring him to\n",
      "\n",
      "me,’ she said, ‘or else you and your ship will su\u0000er incalculable\n",

      "\n",
      "them: ‘The owner of these olives owes me a debt and if you don’t\n",

      "\n",
      "save them from such an unjust tyrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain re-embarked and set sail; God granted him a safe\n",
      "\n",
      "passage to the island, which he reached at night, and he then went\n",
      "\n",
      "up to the orchard. Here Qamar al-Zaman was \u0000nding that the night\n",
      "\n",
      "passed slowly; thinking of his beloved, he sat weeping over what\n",
      "\n",
      "had happened to him and, recalling Budur, he recited these lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is many a night whose stars refuse to move\n",
      "\n",
      "And which has not the power to go.\n",

      "It seems as long as Judgement Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain knocked on Qamar al-Zaman’s door, and when he\n",
      "\n",
      "opened it and came out, the sailors carried him o\u0000 to the ship. They\n",
      "\n",
      "then cast o\u0000 and sailed on, day and night. When Qamar al-Zaman,\n",
      "\n",
      "not knowing the reason for this, asked them about it, they replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are wanted by the lord of the Ebony Islands, the son-in-law of\n",
      "\n",
      "King Armanus, whose money you stole, you ill-fated fellow.’ ‘By\n",
      "\n",
      "God,’ he said, ‘I have never in my life been in that country and I\n",

      "know nothing about it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They sailed on to the islands and brought him to Princess Budur,\n",

      "\n",
      "left with the eunuchs, who were to take him to the baths, and she\n",
      "\n",
      "then released the merchants and gave the captain a robe of honour\n",
      "\n",
      "worth ten thousand dinars. When she went to the palace that night,\n",
      "\n",
      "she told Hayat al-Nufus what had happened and said: ‘Keep this a\n",
      "\n",
      "secret until I get what I want and do something that will be written\n",

      "down and recited after we are dead, to kings and their subjects\n",

      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, on her orders, Qamar al-Zaman had been taken to\n",
      "\n",
      "the baths and then clothed in royal robes. When he came out, he\n",
      "\n",
      "was like a branch of the ban tree or a star whose rising put the sun\n",
      "\n",
      "and moon to shame. He had recovered his spirits and, on entering\n",
      "\n",
      "the palace, he went to Budur. When she saw him, she forced herself\n",
      "\n",
      "to wait in patience until she had done what she wanted. She treated\n",
      "\n",
      "him with favour, giving him mamluks and eunuchs, camels and\n",
      "\n",
      "mules, together with a large sum of money. She continued to\n",
      "\n",
      "promote him from one grade to the next until she made him\n",
      "\n",
      "treasurer, giving him control of the revenues. She treated him as a\n",
      "\n",
      "close associate, and all the emirs, having been told of his status,\n",
      "\n",
      "were well disposed towards him. Every day, Princess Budur would\n",
      "\n",
      "increase his emoluments, while he himself could not understand\n",
      "\n",
      "why it was that she showed him such honour. The extent of his\n",
      "\n",
      "wealth allowed him to make generous gifts, and because of his\n",
      "\n",
      "services, King Armanus grew fond of him, as did the emirs and the\n",
      "\n",
      "people, both high and low, who fell into the habit of swearing by his\n",
      "\n",
      "life.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the while, he himself was astonished at the honours Budur\n",
      "\n",
      "was showering on him, saying to himself: ‘There must be some\n",
      "\n",
      "reason for this a\u0000ection and it may be that the king is showing me\n",
      "\n",
      "such excessive favour for some evil purpose. I shall have to ask his\n",
      "\n",
      "permission to leave his lands.’ So he went to Budur and said: ‘Your\n",
      "\n",
      "majesty, you have treated me with very great favour, but the\n",
      "\n",
      "crowning favour would be permission from you for me to leave, and\n",
      "\n",
      "for you to take back everything that you have generously given me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Budur smiled and said: ‘What has led you to want to run the risk of\n",
      "\n",
      "a voyage when you are being treated with the greatest honour and\n",
      "\n",
      "ever-increasing favour?’ Qamar al-Zaman replied: ‘Your majesty, if\n",
      "\n",
      "this honour comes unprompted, then it is a most remarkable thing,\n",
      "\n",
      "especially as you have promoted me to ranks that are the proper\n",
      "\n",
      "preserve of the old, while I am only a juvenile.’ ‘The reason for this,’\n",
      "\n",
      "said Budur, ‘is that I love you because of your surpassing beauty and\n",
      "\n",
      "your unique loveliness. If you let me have what I want from you, I\n",
      "\n",
      "shall honour you even further with gifts and favours, and young as\n",
      "\n",
      "you are I shall appoint you vizier, just as the people made me their\n",
      "\n",
      "ruler, although I too am young. These days, there is nothing\n",
      "\n",
      "remarkable in the young becoming leaders. How well the poet has\n",
      "\n",
      "expressed it:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is as though our age belongs to the tribe of Lot,\n",
      "\n",
      "Who have a passion for advancing the young.’\n",
      "\n",
      "When Qamar al-Zaman heard this, his cheeks blushed \u0000ery red\n",
      "\n",
      "for shame and he said: ‘I have no need of this honour, which would\n",
      "\n",
      "lead me to commit a sin. Rather, I shall live poor as far as money\n",
      "\n",
      "goes but rich in perfect manliness.’ Budur replied: ‘I am not to be\n",
      "\n",
      "taken in by this piety of yours, which comes from pride and\n",
      "\n",
      "coquetry. How well the poet has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke of a pledge of union and he said to me:\n",

      "But when I showed him a dinar, he changed his tune,\n",

      "of the lines, he said: ‘O king, I am not accustomed to this and I have\n",

      "not the strength to endure such a burden. If those who are older\n",
      "\n",
      "than me cannot bear it, how can I, being only a youth?’ Budur\n",
      "\n",
      "smiled on hearing this and said: ‘It is remarkable how error shows\n",

      "\n",
      "of sinning by committing an unlawful act, when you have not\n",
      "\n",
      "reached the age of responsibility? A minor cannot be blamed or\n",
      "\n",
      "punished for a fault. You have proved the point against yourself by\n",

      "\n",
      "God decrees is destined to come about and I have more cause than\n",
      "\n",
      "you to fear falling into error. How well the poet has expressed it:\n",
      "\n",
      "My tool is large, but the young boy says:\n",

      "“Strike like a hero to the inmost parts.”\n",

      "\n",
      "When Qamar al-Zaman heard this, the light in his eyes turned to\n",

      "content yourself with them and leave me alone? Do what you want\n",

      "with them and let me be.’ ‘What you say is true,’ replied Budur, ‘but\n",

      "\n",
      "Amjad stayed where he was, in a state of perplexity, fearful of the\n",

      "owners of the house and not knowing what to do. ‘Why don’t you\n",
      "\n",
      "come in, light of my eyes and darling of my heart?’ asked the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘To hear is to obey,’ he answered, ‘but the mamluk has been slow\n",

      "He then went in with her, although he was still very fearful at\n",

      "the thought of the owners. On entering he found a \u0000ne hall with\n",
      "\n",
      "four facing alcoves containing small chambers and raised seats\n",
      "\n",
      "spread with silks and brocades. In the centre was a costly fountain,\n",
      "\n",
      "by which were set plates studded with gems and \u0000lled with fruits\n",
      "\n",
      "and scented \u0000owers, while at the side were drinking glasses. There\n",
      "\n",
      "was also a candlestick with a candle, and the place was full of\n",
      "\n",
      "precious materials, with chests and chairs set out, and a package\n",
      "\n",
      "laid on each chair, on top of which was a purse \u0000lled with gold and\n",
      "\n",
      "coins. Judging by the house, its owner was a wealthy man, as its\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000oor was paved with marble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Al-Amjad was taken aback when he saw this, saying to himself: ‘I\n",
      "\n",
      "am a dead man. We belong to God and to Him do we return.’ As for\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "cooked the food and prepared the fruit. I have come at the best of\n",

      "times.’ Al-Amjad, who was preoccupied by his fear of the owners,\n",
      "\n",
      "paid no attention to her. ‘Pooh!’ she exclaimed. ‘My master and my\n",
      "\n",
      "heart, why are you standing like this?’ Then, with a deep sigh, she\n",
      "\n",
      "gave al-Amjad a kiss that sounded like a walnut being cracked, and\n",
      "\n",
      "said: ‘If you are expecting someone else, I’ll do my best to serve her.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Al-Amjad laughed, with a heart full of anger, and he came and sat\n",
      "\n",
      "down, breathing heavily and saying to himself: ‘What a miserable\n",
      "\n",
      "death I shall die when the owner comes!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl sat beside him, laughing playfully, while he was\n",
      "\n",
      "frowning and full of care, turning things over and over in his mind\n",
      "\n",
      "and saying: ‘The owner of this place is bound to come and what am\n",
      "\n",
      "I going to say to him? He will certainly kill me and my life will be\n",
      "\n",
      "gone.’ The girl then got up, tucked up her sleeves, picked up a table,\n",
      "\n",
      "put a cloth on it and started to eat, telling al-Amjad to do the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came to the table to eat, but he couldn’t enjoy the food and kept\n",

      "looking towards the door. When the girl had had enough, she\n",
      "\n",
      "removed the table and, after bringing forward the fruit, she started\n",

      "on the dessert. Next, she brought out the drink, opened the wine-jar\n",
      "\n",
      "and \u0000lled a drinking cup, which she handed to al-Amjad. He took it\n",
      "\n",
      "from her, saying to himself: ‘Oh, oh, what will happen when the\n",
      "\n",
      "owner of the house comes and sees me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "As he held the cup in his hand, his eyes were \u0000xed on the\n",

      "hallway, and it was just then that the owner arrived. He was a\n",
      "\n",
      "mamluk and, as the king’s equerry, he was one of the leading men\n",
      "\n",
      "of the city. He had got the room ready for his own pleasure as a\n",
      "\n",
      "place where he could relax in private with his chosen companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "That day, he had invited a youth whom he loved to visit him and it\n",
      "\n",
      "was for him that he had made these preparations. The mamluk’s\n",
      "\n",
      "name was Bahadur and he was open-handed, generous and liberal in\n",
      "\n",
      "conferring gifts and favours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke o\u0000 from what she had\n",

      "been allowed to say. Then, when it was the two hundred and thirty-\n",

      "\n",
      "I have heard, O fortunate king, that Bahadur, the owner of the\n",
      "\n",
      "house, was the king’s equerry. When he approached the door and\n",
      "\n",
      "found it open, he entered slowly and, peering in, he saw al-Amjad\n",
      "\n",
      "and the girl with a dish of fruit and a wine-jar in front of them. At\n",
      "\n",
      "that moment al-Amjad was holding the drinking cup, with his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000xed on the door. When his eyes caught those of Bahadur, he turned\n",
      "\n",
      "pale and began to tremble. Bahadur saw this change and put his\n",
      "\n",
      "\u0000nger to his mouth to show that he should say nothing but come\n",
      "\n",
      "over to him. Al-Amjad set down his cup and got up to go, and when\n",
      "\n",
      "the girl asked where he was going, he shook his head indicating that\n",
      "\n",
      "he wanted to relieve himself. He went out to the hallway barefooted\n",
      "\n",
      "and when he saw Bahadur he realized that this must be the owner\n",
      "\n",
      "of the house and hurried up to him. After having kissed his hands,\n",
      "\n",
      "he said: ‘In God’s Name, master, I implore you to do me no harm\n",
      "\n",
      "before you hear what I have to say.’ He then told him his story from\n",
      "\n",
      "beginning to end, including why he had left his own kingdom and\n",
      "\n",
      "the fact that he had not come into the hall of his own free will,\n",
      "\n",
      "adding that it was the girl who had broken the lock, opened the\n",
      "\n",
      "door and done it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bahadur listened to the tale of his adventures and, realizing that\n",
      "\n",
      "he was a prince, felt sympathy for him and pitied him. ‘Listen to\n",
      "\n",
      "what I have to say, al-Amjad,’ he said. ‘Obey me and I shall\n",
      "\n",
      "guarantee not to punish you as you fear, while if you disobey me, I\n",
      "\n",
      "shall kill you.’ ‘Tell me to do whatever you want,’ replied al-Amjad.\n",

      "‘I shall never disobey you, for it is your sense of chivalry that has set\n",
      "\n",

      "quietly where you were before and I shall come in. My name is\n",
      "\n",
      "Bahadur and when I come to you, abuse me angrily and say: “Why\n",

      "are you so late?” Don’t accept any excuse from me, but get up and\n",

      "tomorrow you can go o\u0000 on your way, this being the courtesy that\n",

      "to honour them.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Al-Amjad kissed his hand and went back to the room, his face\n",
      "\n",
      "having recovered its pink and white colours. As soon as he came in,\n",
      "\n",
      "he said to the girl: ‘My lady, you have brought delight to this place\n",

      "by your presence here and this is a blessed night.’ ‘It’s a surprise\n",

      "clothes and I didn’t know that you were here. We were supposed to\n",
      "\n",
      "meet in the evening, not in the day.’ ‘You are lying, you vile fellow,’\n",
      "\n",
      "shouted al-Amjad, ‘and I shall have to beat you.’ He rose, threw\n",
