      "{'Then when it was the ninth night, SHE CONTINUED:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that after the sorceress had taken water from the pool and spoken some unintelligible words over it, the fish danced, lifted their heads and immediately rose up, as the magic spell was removed from the city. It became inhabited again, the merchants buying and selling and each man practising his craft, while the islands were restored to their former state. The sorceress went straight away to the tomb and said to the king: ‘Give me your noble hand, my darling, and get up.’ In a low voice, the king replied: ‘Come to me.’ When she did this he, with the drawn sword in his hand, struck her in the breast as she clung on to him, so that it emerged gleaming from her back. With another blow he cut her in two, and threw the two halves on the ground.\\n\\nWhen he came out he found the young man whom she had enchanted standing waiting for him, congratulating him on his escape, kissing his hand and thanking him. The king asked him whether he would prefer to stay in his own city, or to go with him to his. ‘King of the age,’ said the young man, ‘do you know how long a journey it is to your city?’ ‘Two and a half days,’ replied the king. ‘If you have been sleeping,’ said the young man, ‘wake up. Between you and your city is a full year’s worth of hard travelling. You only got here in two and a half days because this place was under a spell. But I shall not part from you for the blink of an eye.’ The king was glad and said: ‘Praise be to God, Who has given you to me. You shall be my son, for all my life I have been granted no other.’\\n\\nThey embraced with great joy and then walked to the palace. Here the young man told his courtiers to make ready for a journey and to collect supplies and whatever was needed. This took ten days, after which the young man and the king set off, the latter being in a fever of anxiety to get back his own city. They travelled with fifty mamluks and magnificent gifts, and their journey continued day and night for a whole year until, as God had decreed their safety, they eventually reached their goal. Word was sent to the vizier that the king had arrived safe and sound, and he, together with his soldiers, who had despaired of him, came to greet him, kissing the ground before him and congratulating him on his safe arrival.\\n\\nThe king then entered the city to take his seat on his throne, and the vizier, on presenting himself and hearing of all that had happened to the young man, added his own congratulations. Then, when things were settled, the king presented gifts to many people and he told the vizier to fetch the man who had brought him the fish and who had been responsible for saving the people of the enchanted city. A messenger was sent to him and when he was brought to the palace, the king presented him with robes of honour and asked him about his circumstances, and whether he had any children. The fisherman replied that he had two daughters and one son. The king sent for them and married one of the girls himself, giving the other to the young man. The fisherman’s son was made treasurer, while the vizier was invested and sent off as ruler of the capital of the Black Islands, the young man’s city. With him were sent the fifty mamluks who had come with the king, and he was given robes of honour to take to the emirs of the city. He kissed the king’s hands and started out immediately, while the king remained with the young man. The fisherman, meanwhile, had become the richest man of his age, while his daughters remained as wives of kings until they died.\\n\\nThis, however, is not more remarkable than what happened to the porter. There was an unmarried porter who lived in the city of Baghdad. One day, while he was standing in the market, leaning on his basket, a woman came up to him wrapped in a silken Mosuli shawl with a floating ribbon and wearing embroidered shoes fringed with gold thread. When she raised her veil, beneath it could be seen dark eyes which, with their eyelashes and eyelids, shot soft glances, perfect in their quality. She turned to the porter and said in a sweet, clear voice: ‘Take your basket and follow me.’ Almost before he was sure of what she had said, he rushed to pick up the basket. ‘What a lucky day, a day of good fortune!’ he exclaimed, following her until she stopped by the door of a house. She knocked at it and a Christian came down to whom she gave a dinar, taking in exchange an olive-coloured jar of strained wine. She put this in the basket and said to the porter: ‘Pick this up and follow me.’ ‘By God,’ repeated the porter, ‘this is a blessed and a fortunate day!’ and he did what she told him.\\n\\nShe then stopped at a fruiterer’s shop, where she bought Syrian apples, Uthmani quinces, Omani peaches, jasmine and water lilies from Syria, autumn cucumbers, lemons, sultani oranges, scented myrtle, privet flowers, camomile blossoms, red anemones, violets, pomegranate blooms and eglantine. All these she put into the porter’s basket, telling him to pick it up. This he did and he followed her until she stopped at the butcher’s, where she got the man to cut her ten ratls’ weight of meat. He did this, and after paying him, she wrapped the meat in banana leaves and put it in the basket, giving the porter his instructions. He picked up the basket and followed her to the grocer, from whom she bought pistachio kernels for making a dessert, Tihama raisins and shelled almonds. The porter was told to pick them up and to follow her. Next she stopped at the sweetmeat seller’s shop. This time she bought a bowl and filled it with all that he had – sugar cakes, doughnuts stuffed with musk, ‘soap’ cakes, lemon tarts, Maimuni tarts, ‘Zainab’s combs’, sugar fingers and ‘qadis’ snacks’.\\n\\nEvery type of pastry was piled on to a plate and put into the basket, at which the porter exclaimed: ‘If you had told me, I’d have brought a donkey with me to carry all this stuff.’ The girl smiled and gave him a cuff on the back of the neck. ‘Hurry up,’ she said. ‘Don’t talk so much and you will get your reward, if God Almighty wills it.’ Then she stopped at the perfume seller’s where she bought ten types of scented water – including rosewater, orange-flower water, waters scented with water lilies and with willow flowers – two sugar loaves, a bottle of musk-scented rosewater, a quantity of frankincense, aloes, ambergris, musk and Alexandrian candles. All of these she put in the basket, telling the porter to pick it up and follow her.\\n\\nHe carried his basket and followed her to a handsome house, overlooking a spacious courtyard. It was a tall, pillared building, whose door had two ebony leaves, plated with red gold. The girl halted by the door, raised the veil from her face and knocked lightly, while the porter remained standing behind her, his thoughts occupied with her beauty. The door opened and, as its leaves parted, the porter looked at the person who had opened it. He saw a lady of medium height, with jutting breasts, beautiful, comely, resplendent, with a perfect and well-proportioned figure, a radiant brow, red cheeks and eyes rivalling those of a wild cow or a gazelle. Her eyebrows were like the crescent moon of the month of Sha‘ban; she had cheeks like red anemones, a mouth like the seal of Solomon, coral red lips, teeth like camomile blossoms or pearls on a string, and a gazelle-like neck. Her bosom was like an ornate fountain, with breasts like twin pomegranates; she had an elegant belly and a navel that could contain an ounce of unguent. She was as the poet described:\\n\\nLook at the sun and the moon of the palaces,\\n\\nAt the jewel in her nose and at her flowery splendour.\\n\\nYour eye has not seen white on black\\n\\nUnited in beauty as in her face and in her hair.\\n\\nShe is rosy-cheeked; beauty proclaims her name,\\n\\nEven if you are not fortunate enough to know of her.\\n\\nShe swayed and I laughed in wonder at her haunches,\\n\\nBut her waist prompted my tears.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the porter stared at her, he lost his wits and the basket almost fell from his head. ‘Never in my life,’ he repeated, ‘have I known a more blessed day than this!’ The girl who had answered the door said to the other, who had brought the provisions: ‘Come in and take the basket from this poor porter.’ So the two girls went in, followed by the porter, and they went on until they reached a spacious, well-designed and beautiful courtyard, with additional carvings, vaulted chambers and alcoves, and furnished with sofas, wardrobes, cupboards and curtains. In the middle of it was a large pool filled with water on which floated a skiff, and at its upper end was a couch of juniper wood studded with gems over which was suspended a mosquito net of red satin, the buttons of whose fastenings were pearls as big as or bigger than hazelnuts.\\n\\nFrom within this emerged a resplendent girl of pleasing beauty, glorious as the moon, with the character of a philosopher. Her eyes were bewitching, with eyebrows like bent bows; her figure was slender and straight as the letter alif; her breath had the scent of ambergris; her lips were carnelian red, sweet as sugar; and her face would shame the light of the radiant sun. She was like one of the stars of heaven, a golden dome, an unveiled bride or a noble Bedouin lady, as described by the poet:\\n\\nIt is as though she smiles to show stringed pearls,\\n\\nHailstones or flowers of camomile.\\n\\nThe locks of her hair hang black as night,\\n\\nWhile her beauty shames the light of dawn.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis third girl rose from the couch and walked slowly to join her sisters in the centre of the hall. ‘Why are you standing here?’ she said. ‘Take the basket from the head of this poor porter.’ The provision buyer or housekeeper came first, followed by the doorkeeper, and the third girl helped them to lower the basket, after which they emptied out its contents and put everything in its place. Then they gave the porter two dinars and told him to be off. For his part, he looked at the lovely girls, the most beautiful he had ever seen, with their equally delightful natures. There were no men with them and, as he stared in astonishment at the wine, the fruits, the scented blossoms and all the rest, he was reluctant to leave. ‘Why don’t you go?’ asked the girl. ‘Do you think that we didn’t pay you enough?’ and with that, she turned to her sister and said: ‘Give him another dinar.’ ‘By God, lady,’ said the porter, ‘it was not that I thought that the payment was too little, for my fee would not come to two dirhams, but you have taken over my heart and soul. How is it that you are alone with no men here and no pleasant companion? You know that there must be four to share a proper feast and women cannot enjoy themselves except with men. As the poet says:\\n\\nDo you not see that four things join for entertainment –\\n\\nHarp, lute, zither and pipe,\\n\\nMatched by four scented flowers –\\n\\nRose, myrtle, gillyflower, anemone.\\n\\nThese only become pleasant with another four –\\n\\nWine, gardens, a beloved and some gold.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are three of you and so you need a fourth, who must be a man of intelligence, sensible, clever and one who can keep a secret.’\\n\\nThe three girls were surprised by what the porter said, and they laughed at him and asked: ‘Who can produce us a man like that? We are girls and are afraid of entrusting our secrets to someone who would not keep them. We have read in an account what the poet Ibn al-Thumam once said:\\n\\nGuard your secret as you can, entrusting it to none,\\n\\nFor if you do, you will have let it go.\\n\\nIf your own breast cannot contain your secret,\\n\\nHow is it to be held by someone else?\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Abu Nuwas has said:\\n\\nWhoever lets the people know his secret\\n\\nDeserves a brand imprinted on his forehead.’\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the porter heard what they said, he exclaimed: ‘By God, I am an intelligent and a trustworthy man; I have read books and studied histories; I make public what is good and conceal what is bad. As the poet says:\\n\\nOnly the trustworthy can keep a secret,\\n\\nAnd it is with the good that secrets are concealed.\\n\\nWith me they are kept locked inside a room\\n\\nWhose keys are lost and whose door has been sealed.’\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the girls heard this quotation, they said: ‘You know that we have spent a great deal of money on this place. Do you have anything with you which you can use to pay us back? We shall not let you sit with us as our companion and to look on our comely and beautiful faces until you pay down some money. Have you not heard what the author of the proverb said: “Love without cash is worthless”?’ The doorkeeper said: ‘My dear, if you have something, you are someone, but if you have nothing, then go without anything.’ At that point, however, the housekeeper said: ‘Sisters, let him be. For, by God, he has not failed us today, whereas someone else might not have put up with us, and whatever debt he may run up, I will settle for him.’ The porter was delighted and thanked her, kissing the ground, but the girl who had been on the couch said: ‘By God, we shall only let you sit with us on one condition, which is that you ask no questions about what does not concern you, and if you are inquisitive you will be beaten.’ ‘I agree, lady,’ said the porter. ‘I swear by my head and my eye, and here I am, a man with no tongue.’\\n\\nThe housekeeper then got up, tucked up her skirts, set out the wine bottles and strained the wine. She set green herbs beside the wine-jar and brought everything that might be needed. She then brought out the wine-jar and sat down with her two sisters, while the porter, sitting between the three of them, thought he must be dreaming. From the wine-jar that she had fetched she filled a cup, drank it, and followed it with a second and a third. Then she filled the cup and passed it to her sister and finally to the porter. She recited:\\n\\nDrink with pleasure and the enjoyment of good health,\\n\\nFor this wine is a cure for all disease.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe porter took the cup in his hand, bowed, thanked her and recited:\\n\\nWine should be drunk beside a trusted friend,\\n\\nOne of pure birth from the line of old heroes.\\n\\nFor wine is like the wind, sweet if it passes scented flowers,\\n\\nBut stinking if it blows over a corpse.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he added:\\n\\nTake wine only from a fawn,\\n\\nSubtle in meaning when she speaks to you,\\n\\nResembling the wine itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter he had recited these lines, he kissed the hand of each of the girls. Then he drank until he became tipsy, after which he swayed and recited:\\n\\nThe only blood we are allowed to drink\\n\\nIs blood that comes from grapes.\\n\\nSo pour this out for me, and may my life\\n\\nAnd all I have, both new and old,\\n\\nServe to ransom your gazelle-like eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the housekeeper took the cup, filled it and gave it to the doorkeeper, who took it from him with thanks and drank it. She then filled it for the lady of the house, before pouring another cup and passing it to the porter, who kissed the ground in front of her, thanked her and recited:\\n\\nFetch wine, by God; bring me the brimming glass.\\n\\nPour it for me; this is the water of life.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then went up to the mistress of the house and said: ‘Lady, I am your slave, your mamluk and your servant.’ He recited:\\n\\nBy the door there stands a slave of yours,\\n\\nAcknowledging your kindly charity.\\n\\nMay he come in, fair one, to see your loveliness?\\n\\nI swear by love itself I cannot leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe replied: ‘Enjoy yourself, drink with pleasure and the well-being that follows the path of health.’ He took the cup, kissed her hand and chanted:\\n\\nI gave her old wine, coloured like her cheeks,\\n\\nUnmixed and gleaming like a fiery brand.\\n\\nShe kissed it and said, laughingly:\\n\\n‘How can you pour us people’s cheeks?’\\n\\nI said: ‘Drink: this comes from my tears;\\n\\nIts redness is my blood;\\n\\nMy breath has heated it within the glass.’\\n\\n\\n\\nShe replied with the line:\\n\\nCompanion, if you have wept blood for me,\\n\\nPour it obediently for me to drink.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe then took the cup, drank it and sat down with her sister. They continued to drink, with the porter seated between them, and as they drank, they danced, laughed and sang, reciting poems and lyrics. The porter began to play with them, kissing, biting, rubbing, feeling, touching and taking liberties. One of them would give him morsels to eat, another would cuff him and slap him, and the third would bring him scented flowers. With them he was enjoying the pleasantest of times, as though he was seated among the houris of Paradise.\\n\\nThey went on in this way until the wine had taken its effect on their heads and their brains. When it had got the upper hand of them, the doorkeeper stood up, stripped off her clothes until she was naked, and letting down her hair as a veil, she jumped into the pool. She sported in the water, ducking her head and then spitting out the water, after which she took some in her mouth and spat it over the porter. She washed her limbs and between her thighs, after which she came out from the water and threw herself down on his lap. ‘My master, my darling, what is the name of this?’ she said, pointing to her vagina. ‘Your womb,’ he replied. ‘Oh!’ she said. ‘Have you no shame?’ and she seized him by the neck and started to cuff him. ‘Your vagina,’ he said, and she cuffed him again on the back of his neck, saying: ‘Oh! Oh! How disgusting! Aren’t you ashamed?’ ‘Your vulva,’ he replied. ‘Do you feel no shame for your honour?’ and she struck him a blow with her hand. ‘Your hornet,’ he said, at which the lady of the house pounced on him and beat him, saying: ‘Don’t speak like that.’\\n\\nWith every new name that he produced, the girls beat him more and more, until the back of his neck had almost dissolved under their slaps. They were laughing among themselves, until he asked: ‘What do you call it, then?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ replied the doorkeeper. ‘Thank God, I am safe now,’ said the porter. ‘Good for you, mint of the dykes.’ Then the wine was passed round again, and the housekeeper got up, took off her clothes and threw herself on to the porter’s lap. ‘What is this called, light of my eyes?’ she asked, pointing at her private parts. ‘Your vagina,’ he said. ‘Oh, how dirty of you!’ she exclaimed, and she struck him a blow that resounded around the hall, adding: ‘Oh! Oh! Have you no shame?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he said, but blows and slaps still rained on the back of his neck. He tried another four names, but the girls kept on saying: ‘No, no!’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he repeated, and they laughed so much that they fell over backwards. Then they fell to beating his neck, saying: ‘No, that’s not its name.’ He said: ‘O my sisters, what is it called?’ ‘Husked sesame,’ they said. Then the housekeeper put her clothes back on and they sat, drinking together, with the porter groaning at the pain in his neck and shoulders.\\n\\nAfter the wine had been passed round again, the lady of the house, the most beautiful of the three, stood up and stripped off her clothes. The porter grasped the back of his neck with his hand and massaged it, saying: ‘My neck and my shoulders are common property.’ When the girl was naked, she jumped into the pool, dived under water, played around and washed herself. To the porter in her nakedness she looked like a sliver of the moon, with a face like the full moon when it rises or the dawn when it breaks. He looked at her figure, her breasts and her heavy buttocks as they swayed, while she was naked as her Lord had created her. ‘Oh! Oh!’ he said, and he recited:\\n\\nIf I compare your figure to a sappy branch,\\n\\nI load my heart with wrongs and with injustice.\\n\\nBranches are most beautiful when concealed with leaves,\\n\\nWhile you are loveliest when we meet you naked.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn hearing these lines, the girl came out of the pool and sat on the porter’s lap. She pointed at her vulva and said: ‘Little master, what is the name of this?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he replied, and when she exclaimed in disgust, he tried ‘the husked sesame’. ‘Bah!’ she said. ‘Your womb,’ he suggested. ‘Oh! Oh! Aren’t you ashamed?’ and she slapped the back of his neck. Whatever name he produced, she slapped him, saying: ‘No, no,’ until he asked: ‘Sisters, what is it called?’ ‘The khan of Abu Mansur,’ they replied. ‘Praise God that I have reached safety at last,’ he said. ‘Ho for the khan of Abu Mansur!’ The girl got up and put on her clothes and they all went back to what they had been doing.\\n\\nFor a time the wine circulated among them and the porter then got up, undressed and went into the pool. The girls looked at him swimming in the water and washing under his beard and beneath his armpits, as they had done. Then he came out and threw himself into the lap of the lady of the house, with his arms in the lap of the doorkeeper and his feet and legs in the lap of the girl who had bought the provisions. Then he pointed to his penis and said: ‘Ladies, what is the name of this?’ They all laughed at this until they fell over backwards. ‘Your zubb,’ one of them suggested. ‘No,’ he said, and he bit each of them. ‘Your air,’ they said, but he repeated ‘No’, and embraced each of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.8998846], 'Then, when it was the seventh night, she continued:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that, when the fish spoke, the girl overturned the pan with her staff and then left by the way she had come, with the wall closing behind her. At that, the vizier got up and said: ‘This is something which must not be kept from the king.’ So he went to the king and told him the story, explaining what he had seen for himself. ‘I must see this with my own eyes,’ said the king, and at that the fisherman was sent for and told to bring another four fish like the others. He went down to the pool with three guards as an escort and brought the fish immediately. The king ordered him to be given four hundred dinars, after which he turned to the vizier and told him: ‘Come and cook these fish in my presence.’ The vizier did as he was told, brought the pan and, after preparing the fish, he put the pan over the fire and threw them into it. As soon as he did so, the wall split open and out came a black slave, tall as a mountain or like a survivor of the race of ‘Ad. In his hand was a green bough and he asked in a hectoring voice: ‘Fish, fish, are you true to your old covenant?’ The fish raised their heads from the pan and replied: ‘Yes, yes, we keep to our covenant.\\n\\nIf you return, we return;\\n\\nIf you keep faith, then so do we,\\n\\nBut if you go off, we are quits.’\\n\\n\\n\\nThe slave came up to the pan, overturned it with the branch that he was holding, and left by the way that he had come. The vizier and the king looked at the fish and saw that they were now like charcoal. The king was amazed and said: ‘This is something that cannot be kept quiet and there must be some secret attached to them.’ So he gave orders for the fisherman to be summoned and when the man came, the king asked him where the fish came from. ‘From a pool surrounded by four mountains,’ replied the fisherman, ‘and it is under the mountain outside the city.’ The king turned and asked: ‘How many days’ journey is it?’ and the fisherman told him that it was half an hour away.\\n\\nThis astonished the king and he ordered his troops to mount and ride immediately, with the fisherman at their head, while the fisherman, in his turn, as he accompanied the king, spent his time cursing the ‘ifrit. The riders climbed up the mountain and then went down into a broad plain that they had never seen before in their lives. Everyone, including the king, was filled with wonder when they looked at it and at the pool in its centre, set as it was between four mountains, with its fish of four colours – red, white, yellow and blue. The king halted in astonishment and asked his soldiers and the others there whether they had ever seen the pool before. ‘King of the age,’ they replied, ‘never in all our lives have we set eyes on it.’ The elderly were asked about it, but they too said that they had never before seen the pool there.\\n\\nThe king then swore by God: ‘I shall not enter my city or sit on my throne again until I find out the secret of this pool and of these fish.’ He gave orders for his men to camp around the mountains, and then summoned his vizier, a learned, wise and sensible man, with a knowledge of affairs. When he came into the king’s presence, the king said to him: ‘I am going to tell you what I want to do. It has struck me that I should go out alone tonight and investigate the secret of this pool and of these fish. I want you to sit at the entrance of my tent and to tell the emirs, viziers, chamberlains and deputies, as well as everyone who asks about me, that I am unwell and that you have my instructions not to allow anyone to come in to see me. Don’t tell anyone what I am planning to do.’\\n\\nThe vizier was in no position to disobey and so the king changed his clothes and strapped on his sword. He climbed down from one of the mountains and walked on for the rest of the night until morning. He spent all the next day walking in the intense heat, and carried on for a second night until morning. At that point, he was pleased to see something black in the distance, and he said to himself: ‘Perhaps I shall find someone to tell me about the pool and the fish.’ When he went nearer he found a palace made of black stones plated with iron, one leaf of whose gate was open and the other shut. Joyfully he stood by the door and knocked lightly; on hearing no reply, he knocked a second and a third time, and when there was still no answer, he knocked more loudly. When no one answered, he was sure that the palace must be empty and so, plucking up his courage, he went through the gate to the passage that led from it, and called out: ‘People of the palace, here is a passing stranger. Have you any food?’\\n\\nHe repeated this a second and a third time, and when there was still no reply, emboldened and heartened, he went through the passage to the centre of the palace. This was furnished with silks, starry tapestries and other hangings, but there was no one there. In the centre was an open space, leading to four halls. There was a stone bench, and one hall next to another, then an ornate fountain and four lions of red gold, from whose mouths water poured, glittering like pearls or gems. Round and about were birds and over the top of the palace there was a net of gold that kept them from flying away, but the king was astonished and saddened that he had not seen anyone whom he could ask about the plain, the pool, the fish, the mountains and the palace.\\n\\nHe was sitting between the doors, sunk in thought, when suddenly he heard a plaintive sound coming from a sorrowful heart, with a voice chanting these verses:\\n\\nI try to hide what I suffer at your hands, but this is clear,\\n\\nWith my eyes exchanging sleep for sleeplessness.\\n\\nTime, you neither spare me nor cease your work,\\n\\nAnd it is between hardship and danger that my heart lies.\\n\\nHave you no mercy on one whom love’s law has abased,\\n\\nOr on the wealthy who is now made poor?\\n\\nI was jealous of the breeze as it blows over you,\\n\\nBut when fate pounces, then men’s eyes are blind.\\n\\nWhat can the archer do if, as he meets the foe,\\n\\nHis bow-string snaps just when he wants to shoot?\\n\\nWhen cares mass to assault a man,\\n\\nWhere can he flee from destiny and fate?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the king heard this lament, he got up and, following the sound, he found a curtain lowered over the door of a room. He lifted it and behind it he found a handsome young man, well made, eloquent, with a bright face, ruddy cheeks and a mole on his cheek like a disc of amber. He was seated on a couch raised one cubit from the ground and he fitted the poet’s description:\\n\\nThere is many a slender one whose dark hair and bright forehead\\n\\nHave made mankind to walk in dark and light.\\n\\nDo not find fault with the mole upon his cheek:\\n\\nI would sell my brother in exchange for such a speck.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe king was glad to see him and greeted him. He, for his part, was sitting there wearing a silk gown embroidered with Egyptian gold, and on his head was a crown studded with gems. He was showing signs of grief, but when the king greeted him, he replied with the utmost courtesy: ‘Your dignity deserves that I should rise for you, but I have an excuse for not doing so.’ ‘I excuse you, young man,’ said the king. ‘I am your guest and I am also here on an important errand. I want you to tell me about the pool, the fish, this palace, the reason why you are here alone and why you are weeping.’\\n\\nWhen the young man heard this, tears coursed down his cheeks and he wept bitterly until his breast was drenched. He then recited:\\n\\nSay to the one to whom Time grants sleep,\\n\\nHow often misfortunes subside only to rise up!\\n\\nWhile you may sleep, God’s eye remains sleepless.\\n\\nFor whom is Time unclouded and for whom do worldly things endure?\\n\\n\\n\\nHe sighed deeply and continued to recite:\\n\\nEntrust your affair to the Lord of all mankind;\\n\\nAbandon care and leave aside anxious thoughts.\\n\\nDo not ask how what happened has occurred,\\n\\nFor all things come about through the decree of fate.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe king, filled with wonder, asked the youth why he was weeping. ‘How can I not shed tears,’ he replied, ‘when I am in this state?’ and he reached down to the skirts of his robe and raised it. It could then be seen that the lower half of his body, down to his feet, was of stone, while from his navel to the hair of his head he was human. When he saw this condition of his, the king was filled with grief and regret. He exclaimed in sorrow: ‘Young man, you have added another care to my cares! I was looking for information about the fish, but now I see I must ask both about them and about you.’ He went on to recite the formula: ‘There is no power and no strength except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent,’ and added: ‘Tell me at once what your story is.’\\n\\n‘Listen and look,’ said the young man. ‘My ears and eyes are ready,’ replied the king, and the young man continued: ‘There is a marvellous tale attached to the fish and to me, which, were it written with needles on the corners of the eyes, would be a lesson for all who can learn.’ ‘How is that?’ asked the king, AND THE YOUNG MAN REPLIED:\\n\\nYou must know that my father was the ruler of this city. His name was Mahmud and he was the king of the Black Islands and of these four mountains. He died after a reign of seventy years and I succeeded him on the throne. I married my cousin, who loved me so deeply that, if I left her, she would neither eat nor drink until my return. She stayed with me for five years but then one day she went in the evening to the baths. I told the cook to prepare a quick supper for me and then I came to these apartments and lay down to sleep in our usual place, telling the slave girls to sit, one at my head and one at my feet. I was disturbed because of my wife’s absence, and although my eyes were shut, I could not sleep and I was still alert.\\n\\nIt was then that I heard the slave girl who was sitting at my head saying to her companion: ‘Mas‘uda, how unfortunate our master is and how miserable are the days of his youth! What damage he suffers at the hands of that damned harlot, our mistress!’ ‘Yes,’ answered the other, ‘may God curse treacherous adulteresses. A man like our master is too young to satisfy this whore, who every night sleeps outside the palace.’ The girl at my head said: ‘Our master is dumb and deluded in that he never asks questions about her.’ ‘Do you think that he knows about her and that she does this with his consent?’ exclaimed the other, adding: ‘She prepares him a drink that he takes every night before he goes to sleep and in it she puts a sleeping drug. He knows nothing about what happens or where she goes. After she has given him the drink, she puts on her clothes, perfumes herself and goes out, leaving him till dawn. Then she comes back to him and burns something under his nose so that he wakes from his sleep.’\\n\\nWhen I heard what the girls were saying, the light became darkness in my eyes, although I could not believe that night had come. Then my wife returned from the baths; our table was spread and we ate, after which we sat for a time talking, as usual. Then she called for my evening drink and when she had given me the cup which she had poured out, I tipped the contents into my pocket, while pretending to be drinking it as usual. I lay down immediately and, pretending to be asleep, I heard her saying: ‘Sleep through the night and never get up. By God, I loathe you and I loathe your appearance. I am tired of living with you and I don’t know when God is going to take your life.’ She then got up, put on her most splendid clothes, perfumed herself and, taking my sword, she strapped it on and went out through the palace gates, while for my part I got up and followed her out. She made her way through the markets until she reached the city gate. She spoke some words that I could not understand, at which the bolts fell and the gate opened.\\n\\nMy wife went out, without realizing that I was following her, and passed between the mounds until she came to a hut with a brick dome. As she went in through its door, I climbed on to the roof and looked down to see her enter and go up to a black slave. One of his lips looked like a pot lid and the other like the sole of a shoe – a lip that could pick up sand from the top of a pebble. The slave was lying on cane stalks; he was leprous and covered in rags and tatters. As my wife kissed the ground before him, he raised his head and said: ‘Damn you, why have you been so slow? My black cousins were here drinking, and each left with a girl, but because of you I didn’t want to drink.’ She said: ‘My master, my darling, delight of my eyes, don’t you know that I am married to my cousin, whose appearance I hate and whose company I loathe? Were it not that I am afraid for you, I would not let the sun rise before the city had been left desolate, echoing to the screeches of owls and the cawing of crows, the haunt of foxes and wolves, and I would move its stones to behind Mount Qaf.’ ‘You are lying, damn you,’ said the black man. ‘I swear by the chivalry of the blacks – and don’t think that our chivalry is like that of the whites – that if you are as late as this once more, I will never again keep company with you or join my body to yours. You are playing fast and loose with me. Am I here just to serve your lust, you stinking bitch, vilest of the whites?’\\n\\nAs I looked on and listened to what they were saying, the world turned black for me and I didn’t know where I was. My wife was standing weeping, humbling herself before the slave and saying: ‘My darling, fruit of my heart, if you are angry with me, who will save me, and if you throw me out, who will shelter me, my darling and light of my eyes?’ She went on weeping and imploring him until, to her delight, she managed to conciliate him. She then got up and took off all her clothes. ‘My master,’ she said, ‘is there anything for your servant to eat?’ ‘Lift the pan cover,’ he said. ‘There are some cooked rat bones beneath it that you can eat, and you can then go to this jar and drink the remains of the beer there.’\\n\\nAfter my wife had eaten and drunk, she washed her hands and her mouth before lying down naked on the cane stalks with the slave, and getting in with him beneath the rags and tatters. When I saw what she had done, I lost control of myself and, climbing down from the top of the roof, I drew the sword that I had brought with me, intending to kill them both. First I struck the neck of the slave, and thought that he was dead…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned on Shahrazad and she broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.81193787], 'When it was the fourth night, Dunyazad asked her to finish the story, if she was not sleepy, and so she went on:\\n\\nI have heard, O fortunate king, that when the fisherman told the ‘ifrit that he would not believe him until he saw this with his own eyes, a shudder ran through the ‘ifrit and he became a cloud of smoke hovering over the sea. Then the smoke coalesced and entered the jar bit by bit until it was all there. Quickly the fisherman picked up the brass stopper with its inscription and put it over the mouth of the bottle. He called out to the ‘ifrit: ‘Ask me how you want to die. By God, I am going to throw you into the sea and then build myself a house in this place so that I can stop anyone who comes fishing by telling them that there is an ‘ifrit here who gives anyone who brings him up a choice of how he wants to be killed.’\\n\\nWhen the ‘ifrit heard this and found himself imprisoned in the bottle, he tried to get out but could not, as he was prevented by Solomon’s seal, and he realized that the fisherman had tricked him. ‘I was only joking,’ he told the fisherman, who replied: ‘You are lying, you most despicable, foulest and most insignificant of ‘ifrits,’ and he took up the bottle. ‘No, no,’ called the ‘ifrit, but the fisherman said: ‘Yes, yes,’ at which the ‘ifrit asked him mildly and humbly what he intended to do with him. ‘I am going to throw you into the sea,’ the fisherman told him. ‘You may have been there for eighteen hundred years, but I shall see to it that you stay there until the Last Trump. Didn’t I say: “Spare me, may God spare you, and do not kill me lest God place you in the power of one who will kill you”? But you refused and acted treacherously towards me. Now God has put you in my power and I shall do the same to you.’ ‘Open the bottle,’ implored the ‘ifrit, ‘so that I can do you good.’ ‘Damned liar,’ said the fisherman. ‘You and I are like the vizier of King Yunan and Duban the sage.’ ‘What is their story?’ asked the ‘ifrit, AND THE FISHERMAN REPLIED:\\n\\nYou must know, ‘ifrit, that once upon a time in the old days in the land of Ruman there was a king called Yunan in the city of Fars. He was a wealthy and dignified man with troops and guards of all races, but he was also a leper, who had taken medicines of various kinds and used ointments, but whose illness doctors and men of learning had been unable to cure.\\n\\nThere was an elderly physician known as Duban the sage, who had studied the books of the Greeks, the Persians, the Arabs and the Syrians. He was a master of medicine and of astronomy and was conversant with the fundamental principles of his subject, with a knowledge of what was useful and what was harmful. He knew the herbs and plants that were hurtful and those that were helpful, as well as having a mastery of philosophy, together with all branches of medicine and other sciences. When this man arrived at the city, within a few days he had heard that the king was suffering from leprosy and that no doctor or man of learning had been able to cure him. He spent the night thinking over the problem, and when dawn broke he put on his most splendid clothes and went to the king, kissing the ground before him and calling eloquently for the continuance of his glory and good fortune. After introducing himself, he went on: ‘I have heard, your majesty, of the disease that has afflicted you and that, although you have been treated by many doctors, they have been unable to remove it. I shall cure you without giving you any medicine to drink or applying any ointments.’\\n\\nYunan was amazed to hear what he had to say and asked how he was going to do that, promising to enrich him and his children’s children. ‘I shall shower favours on you,’ he said, ‘and grant you all your wishes, taking you as a boon companion and a dear friend.’ He then presented Duban with a robe of honour and treated him with favour, before asking: ‘Are you really going to cure my leprosy without medicines or ointment?’ Duban repeated that he would and the astonished king asked when this would be, urging him to be quick. ‘To hear is to obey,’ replied Duban, promising to do this the very next day.\\n\\nDuban now went to the city, where he rented a house in which he deposited his books, his medicines and his drugs. He took some of the latter and placed them in a polo stick, for which he made a handle, and he used his skill to design a ball. The next day, after he had finished, he went into the presence of the king, kissed the ground before him, and told him to ride out to the polo ground and play a game. The king was accompanied by the emirs, chamberlains, viziers and officers of state, and before he had taken his seat on the ground, Duban came up to him and handed him the stick. ‘Take this,’ he said. ‘Hold it like this and when you ride on to the field, hit the ball with a full swing until the palm of your hand begins to sweat, together with the rest of your body. The drug will then enter through your palm and spread through the rest of you. When you have finished and the drug has penetrated, go back to your palace, wash in the baths and then go to sleep, for you will have been cured. That is all.’\\n\\nAt that, the king took the stick from him and mounted, holding it in his hand. He threw the ball ahead of him and rode after it, hitting it as hard as he could when he caught up with it, and then following it up and hitting it again until the palm of his hand and the rest of his body became sweaty because of his grip on the stick. When Duban saw that the drug had penetrated into the king’s body, he told him to go back to his palace and bathe immediately. The king went back straight away and ordered that the baths be cleared for him. This was done, and house boys and mamluks hurried up to him and prepared clothes for him to wear. He then entered the baths, washed himself thoroughly and dressed before coming out, after which he rode back to his palace and fell asleep.\\n\\nSo much for him, but as for Duban the sage, he returned to spend the night in his house, and in the morning he went to ask permission to see the king. On being allowed to enter, he went in, kissed the ground before him and addressed him with these verses which he chanted:\\n\\nVirtues are exalted when you are called their father,\\n\\nA title that none other may accept.\\n\\nThe brightness shining from your face removes\\n\\nThe gloom that shrouds each grave affair.\\n\\nThis face of yours will never cease to gleam,\\n\\nAlthough the face of Time may frown.\\n\\nYour liberality has granted me the gifts\\n\\nThat rain clouds shower down on the hills.\\n\\nYour generosity has destroyed your wealth,\\n\\nUntil you reached the heights at which you aimed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Duban had finished these lines, the king stood up and embraced him, before seating him by his side and presenting him with splendid robes of honour. This was because when he had left the baths he had looked at his body and found it, to his great delight and relief, pure and silver white, showing no trace of leprosy. In the morning, he had gone to his court and taken his seat on his royal throne, the chamberlains and officers of state all standing up for him, and it was then that Duban had come in. The king had risen quickly for him, and after the sage had been seated by his side, splendid tables of food were set out and he ate with the king and kept him company for the rest of the day. The king then made him a present of two thousand dinars, in addition to the robes of honour and other gifts, after which he mounted him on his own horse.\\n\\nDuban went back to his house, leaving the king filled with admiration for what he had done and saying: ‘This man treated me externally without using any ointment. By God, that is skill of a high order! He deserves gifts and favours and I shall always treat him as a friend and companion.’ The king passed a happy night, gladdened by the soundness of his body and his freedom from disease. The next day, he went out and sat on his throne, while his state officials stood and the emirs and viziers took their seats on his right and his left. He asked for Duban, who entered and kissed the ground before him, at which the king got up, greeted him, seated him by his side and ate with him. He then presented him with more robes of honour as well as gifts, and talked with him until nightfall, when he gave him another five robes of honour together with a thousand dinars, after which Duban went gratefully home.\\n\\nThe next morning, the king came to his court, where he was surrounded by his emirs, viziers and chamberlains. Among the viziers was an ugly and ill-omened man, base, miserly and so envious that he was in love with envy. When this man saw that the king had taken Duban as an intimate and had rewarded him with favours, he was jealous and planned to do him an injury. For, as the sayings have it: ‘No one is free of envy’ and ‘Injustice lurks in the soul; strength shows it and weakness hides it.’\\n\\nThis vizier came up to King Yunan, kissed the ground before him and said: ‘King of the age, I have grown up surrounded by your bounty and I have some serious advice for you. Were I to conceal it from you, I would show myself to be a bastard, but if you tell me to give it to you, I shall do so.’ Yunan was disturbed by this and said: ‘What is this advice of yours?’ The vizier replied: ‘Great king, it was a saying of the ancients that Time was no friend to those who did not look at the consequences of their actions. I have observed that your majesty has wrongly shown favour to an enemy who is looking to destroy your kingdom. You have treated this man with generosity and done him the greatest honour, taking him as an intimate, something that fills me with apprehension.’\\n\\nYunan was uneasy; his colour changed and he asked the vizier who he was talking about. ‘If you are asleep, wake up,’ the vizier told him, and went on: ‘I am talking about the sage Duban.’ ‘Damn you!’ exclaimed Yunan. ‘This is my friend and the dearest of people to me, for he cured me through something that I held in my hand from a disease that no other doctor could treat. His like is not to be found in this age or in this world, from west to east. You may accuse him, but today I am going to assign him pay and allowances, with a monthly income of a thousand dinars, while even if I divided my kingdom with him, this would be too little. I think that it is envy that has made you say this, reminding me of the story of King Sindbad.’\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.7352326], 'Then, when it was the eighteenth night, SHE SAID:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that the lady continued to prompt him to leave with her until he said yes. THE LADY WENT ON:\\n\\nI spent the night at his feet, unable to believe what had happened to me because of my joy. In the morning, we got up and, going to the treasuries, we took what was both light to carry and valuable, after which we left the castle and went down to the city. There we met the slaves and the ship’s captain, who were searching for me and who were filled with joy when they saw me. I told them, to their astonishment, what I had seen and explained to them the story of the young man and the reason for the curse that had struck the city, as well as what had happened to its people. When my sisters, now these two bitches, saw me with the young man, they became jealous of me and angry, and they secretly schemed against me. We boarded the ship gaily, overjoyed at the profit we had made, although I was more pleased because of the young man. We stayed waiting for a wind, and when it blew fair, we made sail and set off. My sisters sat with me and we started to talk. ‘What are you going to do with this handsome young man?’ they asked. ‘I intend to take him as my husband,’ I replied. Then, turning, I went up to him and said: ‘Sir, I want to say something to you and I would ask you not to refuse me. When we reach Baghdad, our city, I shall propose myself to you in marriage; you shall be my husband and I shall be your wife.’ He agreed to this, and I turned to my sisters and said: ‘This young man is enough for me, so whatever profit others have made, they can keep.’ ‘That is well done of you,’ they said, but secretly they continued to plot against me.\\n\\nOn we sailed with a fair wind until we left the Sea of Fear and reached safety. After a few more days of sailing, we came in sight of the walls of Basra. Evening fell and we settled down to sleep, but then my sisters got up, carried me on my mattress and threw me into the sea. They did the same thing with the young man, and as he could not swim well, he was drowned and God entered him in the roll of the martyrs. I wish that I had drowned with him, but God decreed that I should be saved, and so while I was floating in the sea, He provided me with a plank of wood on to which I climbed. The waves then swept me along until they threw me up on the shore of an island. There I walked for the rest of the night and, when morning came, I saw a track just broad enough for a human foot that connected the island to the mainland.\\n\\nThe sun had now risen and I dried my clothes in the sunlight, ate some of the island fruits and drank from its water. Then I set off on the track and went on walking until I was close to the mainland and only two hours away from the city. Suddenly, I saw a snake as thick as a palm tree darting towards me, and as it came I could see it swerving to right and to left until it reached me. Its tongue was trailing along the ground for the length of a span and it was sweeping aside the dust with the whole length of its body. It was being pursued by a dragon, thin and long as a lance. In its flight the snake turned to the right and the left, but the dragon seized its tail. The snake shed tears and its tongue lolled out because of its violent efforts to escape. Feeling sorry for it, I picked up a stone and threw it at the dragon’s head, killing it instantly, after which the snake unfolded a pair of wings and flew up into the sky until it passed out of my sight.\\n\\nI sat there in amazement, but I was tired and sleepy and so, for a time, I fell asleep where I was. When I awoke I found at my feet a girl with two bitches who was massaging my feet. I felt embarrassed by her presence and so I sat up and said: ‘Sister, who are you?’ ‘How quickly you have forgotten me,’ she replied. ‘I am the one to whom you did a service, killing my foe and sowing the seed of gratitude. I am the snake whom you saved from the dragon. I am one of the jinn, as was the dragon. He was my enemy and it was only because of you that I escaped from him. After that, I flew on the wind to the ship from which your sisters threw you overboard, and after taking all its cargo to your house, I sank it. As for your sisters, I turned them into two black bitches, for I know the whole story of their dealings with you, but as for the young man, he had already drowned.’ She then carried me off, together with the bitches, and set me down on the roof of my house, in the middle of which I could see all the goods that had been on the ship, not one thing being missing.\\n\\nThen the snake girl said: ‘By the inscription on the ring of our lord Solomon, on whom be peace, if you do not give each of these bitches three hundred lashes every day, I shall come and turn you into a bitch like them.’ I told her that I would obey, and so, Commander of the Faithful, I have gone on beating them, although I feel pity for them and they realize that this is not my fault and accept my excuse. This is my story.\\n\\nThe caliph was filled with wonder, and he then asked the doorkeeper the reason for the whip scars on her body. ‘Commander of the Faithful,’ she replied, ‘when my father died he left a great quantity of wealth, and soon afterwards I married the wealthiest man of his time.’ she went on:\\n\\nI stayed with him for a year, but he too then died and from him I inherited eighty thousand gold dinars, this being my portion in accordance with Islamic law. I was then exceedingly rich; my reputation spread, and I had ten costumes made, each worth a thousand dinars. As I was sitting one day, in came an old woman with pendulous cheeks, thinning eyebrows, popping eyes, broken teeth and a blotched face. She was bleary-eyed, with a head that looked as though it had been covered in plaster, grey hair and a bent body covered in scabs. Her skin was discoloured and she was dribbling mucus, as the poet has described:\\n\\nAn old woman of evil omen – may God have no mercy on her youth\\n\\nOr pardon her sins the day she comes to die –\\n\\nShe could lead a thousand bolting mules\\n\\nWith a spider’s web for reins, so domineering is she.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn entering, this woman greeted me and after she had kissed the ground before me, she said: ‘I have a fatherless daughter and tonight is her wedding and the ceremony of her unveiling. We are strangers with no acquaintances in this city and our hearts are broken. Were you to come to the wedding, you would win reward and recompense from God, as the ladies of the city would hear that you were going and would come themselves. You would then mend my daughter’s broken heart, for her only helper is God.’ She then wept, kissed my feet and recited the lines:\\n\\nYour presence there would honour us,\\n\\nAnd that we would acknowledge.\\n\\nWhile if you do not come,\\n\\nWe have no substitute and no replacement.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoved by pity and compassion, I agreed, saying: ‘I shall do something for her, if God wills, and she shall be married in my clothes with my jewellery and my finery.’ The old woman was delighted: she bent down to kiss my feet and said: ‘May God reward you and mend your heart as you have mended mine. But do not trouble yourself to do this service now. If you are ready in the evening, I will come and fetch you.’ She then kissed my hand and left. I was ready when she came back and she said: ‘My lady, the women of the town have come. I told them that you were going to be there and they were delighted and are waiting for you to arrive.’ So I drew my veil and got up, taking my maids with me, and I went on until we came to a lane that had been swept and sprinkled with water, and where a cool breeze was blowing. There we arrived at an arched gate with a strongly built marble dome, leading to the door of a palace that soared from the ground to touch the clouds. Over the gate these lines were inscribed:\\n\\nI am a house built for pleasure\\n\\nAnd consecrated for all time to joy and relaxation.\\n\\nIn my centre is a fountain with gushing waters\\n\\nThat clear away all sorrows.\\n\\nFlowers border it – anemones and the rose,\\n\\nMyrtle, narcissus blooms and camomile.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we got to the door, the old woman knocked, and when it was opened, we went in to find a hall spread with carpets, in which lighted lamps were hanging and candles were ranged, with gems and precious stones. We walked through the hall until we came to a room of unparalleled splendour, spread with silken rugs and lit by hanging lamps and two rows of candles. In the centre of it there was a couch of juniper wood studded with pearls and gems and covered with a buttoned canopy of satin. Before we knew what was happening, out came a girl. I looked at her, Commander of the Faithful, and saw that she was more perfect than the moon at its full, with a forehead brighter than daybreak, as the poet has said:\\n\\nIn the palaces of the Caesars she is a maiden\\n\\nFrom among the bashful ones of the Chosroes’ courts.\\n\\nOn her cheeks are rosy tokens;\\n\\nHow beautiful are those red cheeks.\\n\\nA slender girl with a languid, sleepy glance,\\n\\nShe encompasses all beauty’s graces.\\n\\nThe lock of hair that hangs above her forehead\\n\\nIs the night of care set over joyful dawn.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe emerged from beneath the canopy and greeted me as her dear and revered sister, giving me a thousand welcomes and reciting:\\n\\nWere the house to know who comes to visit it,\\n\\nIt would kiss in joyfulness the place where you have trod.\\n\\nAnd call out with its silent voice:\\n\\n‘Welcome to the generous and noble one.’\\n\\n\\n\\nShe then sat down and said: ‘Sister, I have a brother who has seen you at a number of weddings and festivals. He is a young man more handsome than I am, and he is deeply in love with you because of the richness of beauty and grace that you possess. He has heard that you are the mistress of your people, as he is the master of his. Because he wished to attach himself to you, he played this trick in order that I should meet you. He wants to marry you in accordance with the ordinance of God and of His Apostle, and there is no disgrace in what is lawful.’ When I heard what she had to say and saw that I was now inside the house, I told her that I would agree. She was delighted and, after clapping her hands, she opened a door from which emerged a young man in the bloom of his youth, immaculately dressed, well built, handsome, graceful, splendid and perfect, with engaging manners. His eyebrows were like an archer’s bow and his eyes could steal hearts with licit magic, as the poet’s description has it:\\n\\nHis face is like a crescent moon,\\n\\nWhere marks of good fortune are like pearls.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow excellent also are the lines:\\n\\nBlessed is his beauty and blessed is our God.\\n\\nHow great is He who formed and shaped this man!\\n\\nAlone he has acquired all loveliness,\\n\\nAnd in his beauty all mankind strays lost.\\n\\nUpon his cheek beauty has written these words:\\n\\n‘I testify there is no handsome man but he.’\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I looked at him, my heart turned to him and I fell in love. He sat beside me and I talked to him for an hour, after which the girl clapped her hands for a second time. The door of a side room opened and from it emerged a qadi with four witnesses, who greeted us and then sat down. The marriage contract between me and the young man was drawn up, after which the others withdrew. ‘May this be a blessed night,’ said my bridegroom, turning to me. ‘But, my lady,’ he added, ‘I impose one condition on you.’ ‘What is that?’ I asked. He got up and fetched a copy of the Quran and said: ‘Swear that you will not look at any other man but me, or incline to him.’ I swore to that, to his great joy. He embraced me and my whole heart was filled with love for him. Servants then set out a table and we ate and drank our fill. Night fell and he took me to bed, where we continued to kiss and embrace until morning.\\n\\nWe continued in this state for a month, living in happiness and joy, and at the end of that time I asked my husband’s leave to go to market to buy some material. After he had given me permission, I put on an outdoor mantle, and taking with me the old woman and a servant girl, I went down to the market. There I sat in the shop of a young merchant who was known to the old woman. She told me that he was a youth whose father had died, leaving him a huge amount of money. ‘He has a great stock of goods,’ she added. ‘You will find whatever you want, and no trader in the market has finer fabrics.’ Then she told the man to produce for me the most expensive stuff that he had and he replied: ‘To hear is to obey.’ The old woman then began to sing his praises, but I told her: ‘There is no necessity for this. All we want is to get what we need and then to go back home.’\\n\\nThe man brought out what we were looking for and we produced the money for him, but he refused to take anything and said: ‘This is a guest gift for you today from me.’ I said to the old woman: ‘If he refuses to accept the money, then give him back the stuff.’ ‘By God,’ he said, ‘I shall not accept anything from you, and all this is a gift from me in exchange for a single kiss, which is of more value to me than everything that is in my shop.’ ‘What good will a kiss do you?’ asked the old woman, but then she told me: ‘You heard what he said, daughter. What harm will a kiss do you, and you can then take what you want?’ ‘Don’t you know that I have sworn an oath?’ I asked, but she went on: ‘Stay silent and let him kiss you. You will have done nothing wrong and you can take back this money.’ She continued to inveigle me, until I fell into the trap and agreed. I then covered my eyes and hid myself from the passers-by with the edge of my veil. He put his mouth on my cheek beneath my veil and, after kissing me, he bit me hard, piercing the skin of my cheek so that I fainted.\\n\\nThe old woman held me to her breast and when I recovered my senses, I found the shop closed, with her grieving over me and saying: ‘God has averted what could have been worse.’ Then she said to me: ‘Come back to the house with me and pull yourself together, lest you be shamed. When you get home, go to bed, pretend to be sick and cover yourself up. I will fetch you something with which to treat this bite and it will soon be better.’ After a while, I got up, full of care and extremely fearful, and I walked very slowly home, where I acted as though I was sick. At nightfall, in came my husband. He asked: ‘My lady, what happened to you while you were out?’ ‘I’m not well,’ I said, ‘and I have a headache.’ He looked at me, lit a candle and came up to me. ‘What is this wound on your tender cheek?’ he asked. ‘After receiving your permission to go out today to buy materials, I left the house but was pushed by a camel carrying firewood; my veil was torn and, as you can see, I got this wound on my cheek, for the streets are narrow here.’ ‘Tomorrow I will go to the governor,’ he said, ‘and tell him to hang everyone who sells firewood in the city.’ I implored him not to burden himself with the guilt of wronging someone, adding: ‘I was riding on a donkey which threw me and I fell on the ground where I struck a piece of wood which grazed my cheek and wounded me.’ He said: ‘Tomorrow I shall go to Ja‘far the Barmecide and tell him what happened to you, so that he may put every donkey driver in this city to death.’ ‘Are you going to kill everyone because of me?’ I asked. ‘What happened was a matter of fate and destiny.’ ‘It must be done,’ he said, and he kept on insisting on this until, when he got up, I turned around and spoke sharply to him.\\n\\nAt that, Commander of the Faithful, he realized what had happened to me. ‘You have been false to your oath,’ he said, letting out a great cry. The door opened and seven black slaves came in. On his orders, they dragged me from my bed and threw me down in the middle of the room. He told one of them to hold my shoulders and to sit on my head, while another was to sit on my knees and hold my feet. A third came with a sword in his hand and my husband ordered him to strike me with the sword and cut me in two and then said: ‘Let each of you take a piece and throw it into the Tigris as food for the fish. This is the reward of those who betray their oaths and are false to their love.’ He grew even more angry and recited these verses:\\n\\nIf I must have a partner in my love,\\n\\nEven though passion slay me, I shall drive love from my soul.\\n\\nI say to my soul: ‘Die nobly,\\n\\nFor there is no good in a love that is opposed.’\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he told the slave: ‘Strike, Sa‘d.’ When the slave was sure that his master meant what he said, he sat over me and said: ‘Lady, recite the confession of faith, and if there is anything that you want done, tell me, for this is the end of your life.’ ‘Wait a little, good slave,’ I said, ‘so that I can give you my last instructions.’ Then I raised my head and saw the state that I was in and how I had fallen from greatness to degradation. My tears flowed and I wept bitterly, but my husband recited angrily:\\n\\nSay to one who has tired of union and turned from me,\\n\\nBeing pleased to take another partner in love:\\n\\n‘I had enough of you before you had enough of me,\\n\\nAnd what has passed between us is enough for me.’\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I heard that, Commander of the Faithful, I wept and, looking at him, I recited:\\n\\nYou have abandoned me in my love and have sat back;\\n\\nYou have left my swollen eyelids sleepless and have slept.\\n\\nYou made a pact between my eyes and sleeplessness.\\n\\nMy heart does not forget you, nor are my tears concealed.\\n\\nYou promised to be faithful in your love,\\n\\nBut played the traitor when you won my heart.\\n\\nI loved you as a child who did not know of love,\\n\\nSo do not kill me now that I am learning it.\\n\\nI ask you in God’s Name that, if I die,\\n\\nYou write upon my tomb: ‘Here lies a slave of love.’\\n\\nIt may be that a sad one who knows love’s pangs\\n\\nWill pass this lover’s heart of mine and feel compassion.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn finishing these lines, I shed more tears, but when my husband heard them and saw my tears, he became even angrier and recited:\\n\\nI left the darling of my heart not having tired of her,\\n\\nBut for a sin that she was guilty of.\\n\\nShe wanted a partner to share in our love,\\n\\nBut my heart’s faith rejects a plural god.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he had finished his lines, I pleaded with him tearfully, telling myself that if I could get round him with words, he might spare my life, even if he were to take everything that I had. So I complained to him of my sufferings and recited:\\n\\nTreat me with justice and do not kill me;\\n\\nThe sentence of separation is unjust.\\n\\nYou loaded me with passion’s heavy weight,\\n\\nAlthough even one shirt is too much for my strength.\\n\\nI am not surprised that my life should be lost;\\n\\nMy wonder is how, after your loss, my body can be recognized.\\n\\n\\n\\nI finished the lines weeping, but he looked at me and rebuffed and reviled me, reciting:\\n\\nYou left me for another and made clear\\n\\nYou were forsaking me; this is not how we were.\\n\\nI shall abandon you as you abandoned me,\\n\\nEnduring without you as you endure my loss.\\n\\nI cease to occupy myself with you,\\n\\nFor you have occupied yourself with someone else.\\n\\nThe severance of our love is set at your door, not at mine.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn finishing these lines, he shouted at the slave: ‘Cut her in half and let us be rid of her, for there is no good to be got from her.’ While we were sparring with each other in this exchange of verses and I had become certain I would die, despairing of life and commending my affair to Almighty God, suddenly in came the old woman, who threw herself at my husband’s feet, kissed them and said tearfully: ‘My son, I have brought you up and served you. I conjure you by this to spare this girl, for she has not committed a crime that deserves death. You are very young and I am afraid lest she involve you in sin – as the saying goes, “Every killer is killed.” What is this slut? Cast her off from you, from your mind and from your heart.’ Then she wept and she kept on pressing him until he agreed and said: ‘I shall spare her life, but I must mark her in a way that will stay with her for the rest of her life.’ On his orders, the slaves then dragged me off, stripped me of my clothes and stretched me out. They sat on me while he fetched a rod from a quince tree and set about beating me. He went on striking my back and sides so severely that I lost consciousness, giving up hope of life. He then told the slaves that when night fell they should take the old woman with them as a guide, carry me off and throw me into my old house. They did as they were told and after throwing me into the house, they went off.\\n\\nIt was not until daybreak that I recovered from my faint and I then tried to soothe my wounds, treating my body with salves and medicines. As you can see, my ribs continued to look as though they had been struck with clubs, and for four months I remained weak and bedridden, tending to my own wounds until I recovered and was cured. I then went to the house that had been the scene of my downfall, only to find it ruined and reduced to a pile of rubble, with the lane in which it stood totally demolished. I could find no news of what had happened and so I came to my half-sister, with whom I found these two black bitches. After greeting her, I told her everything that had happened to me. ‘My sister,’ she said, ‘who is unscathed by the misfortunes of Time? Praise be to God who brought a safe ending to this affair,’ and she started to recite:\\n\\nThis is how Time acts, so show endurance\\n\\nWhether you be stripped of wealth or parted from your love.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe then told me her own story, of what had happened to her with her sisters and how they had ended up. I stayed there with her and the word ‘marriage’ never crossed our lips. We were then joined by this girl who acts as our housekeeper, going out each day to buy what we need for the next twenty-four hours. Things went on like this until last night. Our sister had gone out as usual to buy our food when she returned with the porter, and the three dervishes arrived shortly afterwards. We talked with them, brought them in and treated them well. After only a little of the night had passed, we were joined by three respectable merchants from Mosul. They told us their story and we talked with them, but we had imposed a condition on all our visitors, which they broke. We paid them back for this breach and asked them all for their stories, which they recited. We then forgave them and they left. Today, before we knew what was happening, we were brought before you. This is our story.\\n\\nThe caliph was filled with amazement at this and had the account written down and placed in his archives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.725025], 'Then, when it was the eleventh night, she continued:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that the girl laughed in spite of her anger. She then went up to the men and said: ‘Tell me about yourselves, for you have no more than one hour to live, and were you not people of rank, leaders or governors among your peoples, you would not have been so daring.’ ‘Damn you, Ja‘far,’ the caliph said. ‘Tell her about us or else we shall be killed by mistake, and speak softly to her before we become victims of misfortune.’ ‘That is part of what you deserve,’ replied Ja‘far, but the caliph shouted at him: ‘There is a time for joking, but now is when we must be serious.’ The lady then went to the dervishes and asked them whether they were brothers. ‘No, by God,’ they said, ‘we are only faqirs and foreigners.’ She next asked one of them whether he had been born one-eyed. ‘No, by God,’ he said, ‘but I have a strange and wonderful story about the loss of my eye, which, were it written with needles on the inner corners of the eyeballs, would serve as a warning to those who take heed.’ The second and the third dervish, when asked, made the same reply, and they then said: ‘By God, lady, each of us comes from a different country and each is the son of a king and is a ruler over lands and subjects.’\\n\\nShe turned to them and said: ‘Each of you is to tell his story and explain why he came here and he can then touch his forelock and go on his way.’ The first to come forward was the porter, who said: ‘Lady, I am a porter and this girl, who bought you your provisions, told me to carry them from the wine seller to the fruiterer, from the fruiterer to the butcher, from the butcher to the grocer, from the grocer to the sweetmeat seller and the perfumer, and then here. You know what happened to me with you. This is my story, and that’s all there is.’ The girl laughed and said: ‘Touch your forelock and go.’ ‘By God,’ he said, ‘I am not going to leave until I have heard the stories of my companions.’ THE FIRST DERVISH THEN CAME FORWARD AND SAID:\\n\\nLady, know that the reason why my chin is shaven and my eye has been plucked out is that my father was a king, who had a brother, also a king, who reigned in another city. His son and I were born on the same day. Years later, when we had grown up, I had got into the habit of visiting my uncle every so often, and I would stay with him for some months. My cousin treated me with the greatest generosity, and would kill sheep for me and pour out wine that he strained for me. Once, when we were sitting drinking and were both under the influence of the wine, he said to me: ‘Cousin, there is something that I need from you. Please don’t refuse to do what I want.’ ‘I shall obey you with pleasure,’ I said. After binding me with the most solemn of oaths, he got up straight away and left for a short while. Back he came then with a lady, veiled, perfumed and wearing the most expensive of clothes, who stood behind him as he turned to me and said: ‘Take this woman and go ahead of me to such-and-such a cemetery’ – a place that I recognized from his description. ‘Take her to the burial enclosure and wait for me there.’\\n\\nBecause of the oath that I had sworn, I could not disobey him or refuse his request and so I went off with the woman and we both went into the enclosure. While we were sitting there, my cousin arrived with a bowl of water, a bag containing plaster, and a carpenter’s axe. Taking this axe, he went to a tomb in the middle of the enclosure and started to open it up, moving its stones to one side. Then he used the axe to prod about in the soil of the tomb until he uncovered an iron cover the size of a small door. He raised this, revealing beneath it a vaulted staircase. Turning to the woman, he said: ‘Now you can do what you have chosen to do,’ at which she went down the stairs. My cousin then looked at me and said: ‘In order to complete the favour that you are doing me, when I go down there myself, I ask you to put back the cover and to replace the soil on top of it as it was before. Use the mortar that is in this bag and the water in the bowl to make a paste and coat the circle of the stones in the enclosure so that it looks as it did before, without anyone being able to say: “The inner part is old but there is a new opening here.” I have been working on this for a full year and no one but God knows what I have been doing. This is what I need from you.’ He then took his leave of me, wishing me well, and went down the stairs. When he was out of sight, I got up and replaced the cover and followed his instructions, so that the place looked just as it had before.\\n\\nI then went back like a drunken man to the palace of my uncle, who was away hunting. In the morning, after a night’s sleep, I thought of what had happened to my cousin the evening before and, when repentance was of no use, I repented of what I had done and of how I had obeyed him. Thinking that it might have been a dream, I started to ask after my cousin, but nobody could tell me where he was. I went out to the cemetery, looking for the enclosure, but I could not find it. I kept on going round enclosure after enclosure and grave after grave until nightfall, but I still failed in my search. I returned to the palace, but I could neither eat nor drink, for my thoughts were taken up with my cousin, as I did not know how he was, and I was intensely distressed. I passed a troubled night until morning came, when I went for a second time to the cemetery, thinking over what my cousin had done and regretting that I had listened to him. I went round all the enclosures but, to my regret, I still could not find the right one or recognize the grave.\\n\\nFor seven days I went on with my fruitless quest, and my misgivings increased until I was almost driven mad. The only relief I could find was to leave and go back to my father, but as soon as I reached the gate of his city, I was attacked by a group of men who tied me up. I was astonished, seeing that I was the son of the city’s ruler and they were my father’s servants, and in my alarm I said to myself: ‘What can have happened to my father?’ I asked my captors why they were doing this. At first they did not answer, but after a time one of them, who had been a servant of mine, said: ‘Your father has fallen victim to the treachery of Time. The army conspired against him and he was killed by the vizier, who has taken his place. It was on his orders that we were watching out for you.’\\n\\nI was stunned by what I heard about my father and fearful because I had a long-standing quarrel with the vizier, before whom my captors now brought me. I had been passionately fond of shooting with a pellet bow and the quarrel arose from this. One day when I was standing on the roof of my palace, a bird settled on the roof of the palace of the vizier. I intended to shoot it, but the pellet missed and, as had been decreed by fate, it struck out the eye of the vizier. This was like the proverb expressed in the old lines:\\n\\nWe walked with a pace that was decreed for us,\\n\\nAnd this is how those under fate’s control must walk.\\n\\nA man destined to die in a certain land\\n\\nWill not find death in any other.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the vizier lost his eye, he could not say anything because my father was the king of the city, and this was why he was my enemy. When I now stood before him with my hands tied, he ordered my head to be cut off. ‘For what crime do you kill me?’ I asked. ‘What crime is greater than this?’ he replied, pointing to his missing eye. ‘I did that by accident,’ I protested. ‘If you did it by accident,’ he replied, ‘I am doing this deliberately.’ Then he said: ‘Bring him forward.’ The guards brought me up in front of him, and sticking his finger into my right eye, the vizier plucked it out, leaving me from that time on one-eyed, as you can see. Then he had me tied up and put in a box, telling the executioner: ‘Take charge of him; draw your sword and when you have brought him outside the city, kill him and let the birds and beasts eat him.’\\n\\nThe executioner took me out of the city to the middle of the desert and then he removed me from the box, bound as I was, hand and foot. He was about to bandage my eyes before going on to kill me, but I wept so bitterly that I moved him to tears. Then, looking at him, I recited:\\n\\nI thought of you as a strong coat of mail\\n\\nTo guard me from the arrows of my foes,\\n\\nBut you are now the arrow head.\\n\\nI pinned my hopes on you in all calamities\\n\\nWhen my right hand could no longer aid my left.\\n\\nLeave aside what censurers say,\\n\\nAnd let my enemies shoot their darts at me.\\n\\nIf you do not protect me from my foes,\\n\\nAt least your silence neither hurts me nor helps them.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are also other lines:\\n\\nI thought my brothers were a coat of mail;\\n\\nThey were, but this was for the enemy.\\n\\nI thought of them as deadly shafts;\\n\\nThey were, but their points pierced my heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe executioner had been in my father’s service and I had done him favours, so when he heard these lines, he said: ‘Master, what can I do? I am a slave under command.’ But then he added: ‘Keep your life, but don’t come back to this land or else you will be killed and you will destroy me, together with yourself. As one of the poets has said:\\n\\nIf you should meet injustice, save your life\\n\\nAnd let the house lament its builder.\\n\\nYou can replace the country that you leave,\\n\\nBut there is no replacement for your life.\\n\\nI wonder at those who live humiliated\\n\\nWhen God’s earth is so wide.\\n\\nSend out no messenger on any grave affair,\\n\\nFor only you yourself will give you good advice.\\n\\nThe necks of lions would not be so thick\\n\\nWere others present to look after them.’\\n\\n\\n\\nI kissed his hands, scarcely believing that I had escaped death, in comparison with which I found the loss of my eye insignificant. So I travelled to my uncle’s city and, after presenting myself to him, I told him what had happened to my father, as well as how I had come to lose my eye. He burst into tears and said: ‘You have added to my cares and my sorrows. For your cousin disappeared days ago and I don’t know what has happened to him, nor can anyone bring me news.’ He continued to weep until he fainted and I was bitterly sorry for him. He then wanted to apply some medicaments to my eye, but when he saw that it was like an empty walnut shell, he said: ‘Better to lose your eye, my boy, than to lose your life.’\\n\\nAt that, I could no longer stay silent about the affair of my cousin, his son, and so I told him all that had happened. When he heard my news, he was delighted and told me to come and show him the enclosure. ‘By God, uncle,’ I said, ‘I don’t know where it is. I went back a number of times after that and searched, but I couldn’t find the place.’ Then, however, he and I went to the cemetery and, after looking right and left, to our great joy I recognized the place. The two of us went into the enclosure and, after removing the earth, we lifted the cover. We climbed down fifty steps and when we had reached the bottom, we were met by blinding smoke. ‘There is no might and no power except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent,’ exclaimed my uncle – words that can never put to shame anyone who speaks them. We walked on and found ourselves in a hall filled with flour, grain, eatables and so on, and there in the middle of it we saw a curtain hanging down over a couch. My uncle looked and found his son and the woman who had gone down with him locked in an embrace, but they had become black charcoal, as though they had been thrown into a pit of fire.\\n\\nOn seeing this, my uncle spat in his son’s face and said: ‘You deserve this, you pig. This is your punishment in this world, but there remains the punishment of the next world, which will be harsher and stronger.’ Morning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.\\n': [0.7183881], 'Then, when it was the sixth night, her sister, Dunyazad, told her to finish the story and Shahrazad said: ‘If the king permits me.’ ‘Go on,’ he replied, AND SHE CONTINUED:\\n\\nI have heard, O fortunate king, that the fisherman told the ‘ifrit: ‘Had you spared me, I would have spared you, but you wanted nothing but my death and so now I am going to destroy you by throwing you into the sea here, imprisoned in this bottle.’ The ‘ifrit cried out: ‘I implore you, in God’s Name, fisherman, don’t do this! Spare me and don’t punish me for what I did. If I treated you badly, do you for your part treat me well, as the proverb says: “You who do good to the evil-doer, know that what he has done is punishment enough for him.” Do not do what ‘Umama did to ‘Atika!’ ‘What was that?’ asked the fisherman, but the ‘ifrit said: ‘I cannot talk while I am imprisoned, but if you let me out, I shall tell you the story.’ The fisherman said: ‘Stop talking like this, for I shall certainly throw you into the sea and I am never going to release you. I pleaded with you and begged you, but all you wanted to do was to kill me, although I had done nothing at all to deserve this and, far from doing you any harm, I had helped you by freeing you from your prison. When you did that to me, I realized that you were an evil-doer. Be sure that, when I throw you into the sea, if anyone brings you out, I will tell him what you did to me and warn him, so that he may throw you back again and there you will stay until the end of time or until you perish.’ ‘Free me,’ pleaded the ‘ifrit. ‘This is a time for generosity and I promise you that I shall never act against you again but will help you by making you rich.’\\n\\nAt this, the fisherman made the ‘ifrit promise that were he freed, far from hurting his rescuer, he would help him. When the fisherman was sure of this and had made the ‘ifrit swear by the greatest Name of God, he opened the bottle and the smoke rose up, until it had all come out and had formed into a hideous shape. The ‘ifrit then picked the bottle up and hurled it into the sea, convincing the watching fisherman that he was going to be killed. The man soiled his trousers, crying: ‘This is not a good sign!’ but then his courage came back and he said: ‘God Almighty has said: “Fulfil your promise, for your promise will be questioned.”* You gave me your word, swearing that you would not act treacherously to me, as otherwise God will do the same to you, for He is a jealous God Who bides His time but does not forget. I say to you what Duban the wise said to King Yunan: “Spare me and God will spare you.” ’\\n\\nThe ‘ifrit laughed and told the fisherman to follow him as he walked ahead. This the fisherman did, scarcely believing that he was safe. The pair of them left the city, climbed a mountain and then went down into a wide plain. There they saw a pool, and after the ‘ifrit had waded into the middle of it, he asked the fisherman to follow him, which he did. When the ‘ifrit stopped, he told the fisherman to cast his net, and the man was astonished to see that the pond contained coloured fish – white, red, blue and yellow. He took out his net, cast it and when he drew it in he found four fish, each a different colour. He was delighted by this, and the ‘ifrit said: ‘Present these to the sultan and he will enrich you. Then I ask you in God’s Name to excuse me, since at this time I know no other way to help you. I have been in the sea for eighteen hundred years and this is the first time that I have seen the face of the land.’ After advising the fisherman not to fish the pool more than once a day, he took his leave, speaking words of farewell. Then he stamped his foot on the earth and a crack appeared into which he was swallowed.\\n\\nThe fisherman returned to the city, full of wonder at his encounter. He took the fish to his house, where he brought out an earthenware bowl, filled it with water and put them in it. As they wriggled about in the water, he placed the bowl on his head and went to the palace as the ‘ifrit had told him. When he came to the king and presented him with the fish, the king was astonished, for never in his life had he seen anything like them. He gave orders that they were to be handed over to a slave girl who was acting as cook but whose skill had not yet been tested, as she had been given him three days earlier by the king of Rum. The vizier told her to fry the fish, adding that the king had said that he was testing her only in the hour of need, and that he was putting his hopes in her artistry and cooking skills, for the fish had been given him as a present.\\n\\nAfter issuing these instructions, the vizier went back to the king, who told him to hand the fisherman four hundred dinars. After he had passed over the money, the man stowed it inside his clothes and set off back home at a run, falling, getting up and then stumbling again, thinking that this was all a dream. He bought what was needed for his family and then returned to his wife in joy and delight.\\n\\nSo much for him, but as for the slave girl, she took the fish and cleaned them. Then, after setting the frying pan on the fire, she put the fish in it and when one side was properly cooked, she turned them on to the other. All of a sudden, the kitchen wall split open and out came a girl, with a beautiful figure and smooth cheeks, perfect in all her attributes. Her eyes were darkened with kohl and she had on a silken kaffiyeh with a blue fringe. She was wearing earrings; on her wrists were a pair of bracelets, while her fingers were adorned with rings set with precious gems, and in her hand she held a bamboo staff. Thrusting this into the pan, she asked: ‘Fish, are you still faithful to your covenant?’ at which the cook fainted. The girl repeated her question a second and a third time and the fish raised their heads from the pan and said: ‘Yes, yes,’ in clear voices, and then they recited:\\n\\nIf you return, we return;\\n\\nIf you keep faith, then so do we,\\n\\nBut if you go off, we are quits.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that, the girl turned the pan upside down with her staff and left through the hole from which she had come, after which the wall closed up behind her. The cook recovered from her faint and saw the four fish burned like black charcoal. She exclaimed: ‘His spear was broken on his very first raid!’ and fell unconscious again on the floor. While she was in this confused state, the vizier came and saw that something had gone badly wrong with her, so much so that she could not even tell what day of the week it was. He nudged her with his foot, and when she had recovered her senses, she explained to him, in tears, what had happened. He was astonished, and exclaimed: ‘This is something wonderful!’ He then sent for the fisherman and, when he was brought in, the vizier told him to fetch another four fish like the first ones.\\n\\nThe fisherman went to the pool, cast his net and when he drew it in, there were four fish like the first. He took them to the vizier, who brought them to the cook and said: ‘Fry these in front of me so that I can see what happens.’ The cook got up, prepared the fish, put the pan over the fire and threw them into it. As soon as she did, the wall split open and out came the girl, looking as she had done before, with a staff in her hand. She prodded the pan and asked: ‘Fish, fish, are you true to your old covenant?’ At this, all the fish raised their heads and repeated the lines:\\n\\nIf you return, we return;\\n\\nIf you keep faith, then so do we,\\n\\nBut if you go off, we are quits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say. ': [0.710171], 'Then, when it was the tenth night, her sister Dunyazad said: ‘Finish your story.’ ‘With pleasure,’ she replied, and she continued:\\n\\nI have heard, O fortunate king, that the girls produced three names for the porter, while he kissed, bit and embraced them until he was satisfied. They went on laughing until they said: ‘What is its name, then, brother?’ ‘Don’t you know?’ ‘No.’ ‘This is the mule that breaks barriers, browses on the mint of the dykes, eats the husked sesame and that passes the night in the khan of Abu Mansur.’ The girls laughed until they fell over backwards and then they continued with their drinking party, carrying on until nightfall.\\n\\nAt this point, they told the porter that it was time for him to get up, put on his gaiters and go – ‘Show us the width of your shoulders.’ ‘By God,’ said the porter, ‘if the breath of life were to leave me, it would be easier for me to bear than having to part from you. Let me link night with day, and in the morning we can all go our separate ways.’ The girl who had bought the provisions pleaded with the others: ‘Let him sleep here so that we can laugh at him. Who knows whether in all our lives we shall meet someone else like him, both wanton and witty.’ They then said: ‘You can only spend the night with us on condition that you accept our authority and that you don’t ask about anything you see or the reason for it.’ The porter agreed to this, and they then told him: ‘Get up and read what is written over the door.’ He went to the door and there he found written above it in gold leaf: ‘Whoever talks about what does not concern him will hear what will not please him.’ ‘I call you to witness,’ he said, ‘that I shall not talk about what is no concern of mine.’\\n\\nThe housekeeper got up and prepared a meal for them, which they ate, and then they lit candles and lamps, dipping ambergris and aloes into the candles. They sat drinking and talking of past loves, after having reset the table with fresh fruits and more wine. They continued for a time, eating, drinking, carousing together over their dessert, laughing and teasing each other, when suddenly there was a knock on the door. This did not disrupt the party, however, and one of the girls went by herself to the door and returned to report: ‘Our happiness is complete tonight.’ ‘How is that?’ the others asked. She told them: ‘At the door are three Persian dervishes, with shaven chins, heads and eyebrows. By a very remarkable coincidence, each of them has lost his left eye. They have only just arrived after a journey; they are showing the signs of travel and this is the first time that they have been to our city, Baghdad. They knocked on our door because they couldn’t find a lodging for the night and they had said to themselves: “Perhaps the owner of this house would give us the key to a stable or to a hut in which we could pass the night.” For they had been caught out by nightfall, and, being strangers, they had no acquaintance who might give them shelter – and, sisters, each of them is of a ludicrous appearance.’\\n\\nShe continued to persuade and cajole until the others agreed to let the Persians come in on condition that they would not talk about what did not concern them lest they hear what would not please them. The girl went off joyfully and came back with the three one-eyed men, with shaven beards and moustaches. They spoke words of greeting, bowed and hung back. The girls got up to welcome them and, after congratulating them on their safe arrival, told them to be seated.\\n\\nWhat the visitors saw was a pleasant and clean room, furnished with greenery, where there were lighted candles, incense rising into the air, dessert, fruits and wine, together with three virgin girls. ‘This is good, by God,’ they all agreed. Then they turned to the porter and found him cheerfully tired out and drunk. They thought, on seeing him, that he must be one of their own kind and said: ‘This is a dervish like us, either a foreigner or an Arab.’ Hearing this, the porter glowered at them and said: ‘Sit down and don’t be inquisitive. Didn’t you read what is written over the door? It is not for poor men who arrive like you to let loose your tongues at us.’ The newcomers apologized submissively, and the girls laughed and made peace between them and the porter, after which food was produced for the new arrivals, which they ate.\\n\\nThey then sat drinking together, with the doorkeeper pouring the wine and the wine cup circulating among them. The porter then asked the visitors whether they had some story or anecdote to tell. Heated by wine, they, in their turn, asked for musical instruments and were brought a tambourine, a lute and a Persian harp by the doorkeeper. They then got up and tuned the instruments, after which each one took one of them, struck a note and began to sing. The girls added a shrill accompaniment and the noise rose. Then, while this was going on, there was a knock at the door and the doorkeeper got up to see what was going on.\\n\\nThe reason for this knocking was that the caliph Harun al-Rashid was in the habit of going around disguised as a merchant and he had come down from his palace that night on an excursion to listen to the latest news, accompanied by his vizier, Ja‘far, and Masrur, his executioner. On his way through the city, he and his companions had happened to pass that house, where they heard music and singing. He had said to Ja‘far: ‘I want to go in here so that we may listen to these voices and see their owners.’ Ja‘far had replied: ‘Commander of the Faithful, these people are drunk and I am afraid that they may do us some harm.’ The caliph had then said: ‘I must enter and I want you to think of some scheme to get us in.’ ‘To hear is to obey,’ Ja‘far had replied, before going up and knocking on the door. When it was opened by the doorkeeper, Ja‘far advanced and kissed the ground. ‘Lady,’ he said, ‘we are traders from Tiberias who have been in Baghdad for ten days. We have sold our goods and are staying at the merchants’ khan, but this evening we were invited out by a colleague. We went to his house and, after he had given us a meal, we sat drinking with him for a time, but when he let us go night had fallen and, as we are strangers here, we could not find our way back to our hostel. Of your charity, and may God reward you, would you let us come in and spend the night with you?’\\n\\nThe girl looked at them and saw that they were dressed as merchants and appeared to be respectable people. So she went back to her sisters and passed on Ja‘far’s message. The others sympathized with the visitors’ plight and told her: ‘Let them in,’ after which she went back and opened the door. The caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur came in and when the girls saw them, they stood up, seated their visitors and ministered to their needs, saying: ‘Welcome to our guests, but we lay a condition on you.’ ‘What is that?’ they asked. ‘That you do not speak of what does not concern you, lest you hear what will not please you.’ ‘We agree,’ they replied, and they sat down to drink together.\\n\\nLooking at the three dervishes, the caliph was surprised to find that each of them had lost his left eye. He was also thrown into confusion by the beauty and grace of the girls, which prompted his admiration. They began to drink together and to talk, but when the girls invited the caliph to drink, he said: ‘I am proposing to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca.’ The doorkeeper then got up and brought him an embroidered table cloth on which she set a china jar in which she poured willow-flower water, adding some snow and a sugar lump. The caliph thanked her and said to himself: ‘By God, I shall reward her tomorrow for the good that she has done me.’\\n\\nThen they all occupied themselves with drinking, and when the drink had gained the upper hand, the lady of the house got up, bowed to the company and then, taking the housekeeper by the hand, she said: ‘Sisters, come, we must settle our debt.’ ‘Yes,’ agreed the other two girls, and at that, the doorkeeper got up in front of them and first cleared the table, removed the debris, replaced the perfumes and cleared a space in the middle of the room. The dervishes were made to sit on a bench on one side of the room and the caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur on a bench on the other side. Then the lady of the house called to the porter: ‘Your friendship does not amount to much. You are not a stranger, but one of the household.’ The porter got up, tightened his belt and asked: ‘What do you want?’ ‘Stay where you are,’ she said. Then the housekeeper stood up and set a chair in the middle of the room, opened a cupboard and said to the porter: ‘Come and help me.’\\n\\nIn the cupboard he saw two black bitches, with chains around their necks. ‘Take them,’ said the girl, and he took them and brought them to the centre of the room. Then the lady of the house got up, rolled back her sleeves and took up a whip. ‘Bring one of them,’ she told the porter, and he did this, pulling the bitch by its chain, as it whimpered and shook its head at the girl. It howled as she struck it on the head, and she continued to beat it until her arms were tired. She then threw away the whip, pressed the bitch to her breast and wiped away its tears with her hand, kissing its head. Then she said to the porter: ‘Take this one away and bring the other.’ This he did and she treated the second bitch in the same way as the first.\\n\\nThe caliph was concerned and troubled by this. Unable to contain his curiosity about the story of the two bitches, he winked at Ja‘far, but the latter turned to him and gestured to him to remain silent. Then the lady of the house turned to the doorkeeper and said: ‘Get up and do your duty.’ ‘Yes,’ she replied and, getting up, she went to the couch, which was made of juniper wood with panels of gold and silver. Then the lady of the house said to the other two girls: ‘Bring out what you have.’ The doorkeeper sat on a chair by her side, while the housekeeper went into a closet and came out with a satin bag with green fringes and two golden discs. She stood in front of the lady of the house, unfastened the bag and took from it a lute whose strings she tuned and whose pegs she tightened, until it was all in order. Then she recited:\\n\\nYou are the object of my whole desire;\\n\\nUnion with you, beloved, is unending bliss,\\n\\nWhile absence from you is like fire.\\n\\nYou madden me, and throughout time\\n\\nIn you is centred the infatuation of my love.\\n\\nIt brings me no disgrace that I love you.\\n\\nThe veils that cover me are torn away by love,\\n\\nAnd love continues shamefully to rend all veils.\\n\\nI clothe myself in sickness; my excuse is clear.\\n\\nFor through my love, you lead my heart astray.\\n\\nFlowing tears serve to bring my secret out and make it plain.\\n\\nThe tearful flood reveals it, and they try\\n\\nTo cure the violence of this sickness, but it is you\\n\\nWho are for me both the disease and its cure.\\n\\nFor those whose cure you are, the pains last long.\\n\\nI pine away through the light shed by your eyes,\\n\\nAnd it is my own love whose sword kills me,\\n\\nA sword that has destroyed many good men.\\n\\nLove has no end for me nor can I turn to consolation.\\n\\nLove is my medicine and my code of law;\\n\\nSecretly and openly it serves to adorn me.\\n\\nYou bring good fortune to the eye that looks\\n\\nIts fill on you, or manages a glance.\\n\\nYes, and its choice of love distracts my heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the lady of the house heard these lines, she cried: ‘Oh! Oh! Oh!’, tore her clothes and fell to the ground in a faint. The caliph was astonished to see weals caused by the blows of a whip on her body, but then the doorkeeper got up, sprinkled water over her and clothed her in a splendid dress that she had fetched for her sister. When they saw that, all the men present were disturbed, as they had no idea what lay behind it. The caliph said to Ja‘far: ‘Don’t you see this girl and the marks of a beating that she shows? I can’t keep quiet without knowing the truth of the matter and without finding out about this girl and the two black bitches.’ Ja‘far replied: ‘Master, they made it a condition that we should not talk about what did not concern us, lest we hear what we do not like.’\\n\\nAt this point, the doorkeeper said: ‘Sister, keep your promise and come to me.’ ‘Willingly,’ said the housekeeper, and she took the lute, cradled it to her breasts, touched it with her fingers and recited:\\n\\nIf I complain of the beloved’s absence, what am I to say?\\n\\nWhere can I go to reach what I desire?\\n\\nI might send messengers to explain my love,\\n\\nBut this complaint no messenger can carry.\\n\\nI may endure, but after he has lost\\n\\nHis love, the lover’s life is short.\\n\\nNothing remains but sorrow and then grief,\\n\\nWith tears that flood the cheeks.\\n\\nYou may be absent from my sight but you have still\\n\\nA settled habitation in my heart.\\n\\nI wonder, do you know our covenant?\\n\\nLike flowing water, it does not stay long.\\n\\nHave you forgotten that you loved a slave,\\n\\nWho finds his cure in tears and wasted flesh?\\n\\nAh, if this love unites us once again,\\n\\nI have a long complaint to make to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the doorkeeper heard this second poem, she cried out and said: ‘That is good, by God.’ Then she put her hand to her clothes and tore them, as the first girl had done, and fell to the ground in a faint. The housekeeper got up and, after sprinkling her with water, clothed her in a new dress. The doorkeeper then rose and took her seat before saying: ‘Give me more and pay off the debt you owe me.’ So the housekeeper brought her lute and recited:\\n\\nHow long will you so roughly turn from me?\\n\\nHave I not poured out tears enough?\\n\\nHow long do you plan to abandon me?\\n\\nIf this is thanks to those who envy me,\\n\\nTheir envy has been cured.\\n\\nWere treacherous Time to treat a lover fairly,\\n\\nHe would not pass the night wakeful and wasted by your love.\\n\\nTreat me with gentleness; your harshness injures me.\\n\\nMy sovereign, is it not time for mercy to be shown?\\n\\nTo whom shall I tell of my love, you who kill me?\\n\\nHow disappointed are the hopes of the one who complains,\\n\\nWhen faithfulness is in such short supply!\\n\\nMy passion for you and my tears increase,\\n\\nWhile the successive days you shun me are drawn out.\\n\\nMuslims, revenge the lovesick, sleepless man,\\n\\nThe pasture of whose patience has scant grass.\\n\\nDoes love’s code permit you, you who are my desire,\\n\\nTo keep me at a distance while another one\\n\\nIs honoured by your union? What delight or ease\\n\\nCan the lover find through nearness to his love,\\n\\nWho tries to see that he is weighted down by care?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the doorkeeper heard this poem, she put her hand on her dress and ripped it down to the bottom. She then fell fainting to the ground, showing marks of a beating. The dervishes said: ‘It would have been better to have slept on a dunghill rather than to have come into this house, where our stay has been clouded by something that cuts at the heart.’ ‘Why is that?’ asked the caliph, turning to them. ‘This affair has distressed us,’ they replied. ‘Do you not belong to this household?’ he asked. ‘No,’ they replied. ‘We have never seen the place before.’ The caliph was surprised and said, gesturing at the porter: ‘This man with you may know about them.’ When they asked him, however, he said: ‘By Almighty God, love makes us all equal. I have grown up in Baghdad but this is the only time in my life that I ever entered this house and how I came to be here with these girls is a remarkable story.’\\n\\nThe others said: ‘By God, we thought that you were one of them, but now we see that you are like us.’ The caliph then pointed out: ‘We are seven men and they are three women. There is no fourth. So ask them about themselves, and if they don’t reply willingly, we will force them to do so.’ Everyone agreed except for Ja‘far, who said: ‘Let them be; we are their guests and they made a condition which we accepted, as you know. It would be best to let the matter rest, for there is only a little of the night left and we can then go on our ways.’ He winked at the caliph and added: ‘There is only an hour left and tomorrow we can summon them to your court and ask for their story.’ The caliph raised his head and shouted angrily: ‘I cannot bear to wait to hear about them; let the dervishes question them.’ ‘I don’t agree,’ said Ja‘far, and the two of them discussed and argued about who should ask the questions until they both agreed that it should be the porter.\\n\\nThe lady of the house asked what the noise was about and the porter got up and said to her: ‘My lady, these people would like you to tell them the story of the two bitches and how you come to beat them and then to weep and kiss them. They also want to know about your sister and why she has been beaten with rods like a man. These are their questions to you.’ ‘Is it true what he says about you?’ the lady of the house asked the guests, and all of them said yes, except for Ja‘far, who stayed silent. When the lady heard this, she told them: ‘By God, you have done us a great wrong. We started by making it a condition that if any of you talked about what did not concern him, he would hear what would not please him. Wasn’t it enough for you that we took you into our house and shared our food with you? But the fault is not so much yours as that of the one who brought you in to us.’\\n\\nThen she rolled her sleeve back above the wrist and struck the floor three times, saying: ‘Hurry.’ At this, the door of a closet opened and out came seven black slaves, with drawn swords in their hands. ‘Tie up these men who talk too much,’ she said, ‘and bind them one to the other.’ This the slaves did, after which they said: ‘Lady, give us the order to cut off their heads.’ She replied: ‘Let them have some time so that I may ask them about their circumstances before their heads are cut off.’ ‘God save me,’ said the porter. ‘Don’t kill me, lady, for someone else’s fault. All the rest have done wrong and have committed a fault except me. By God, it would have been a pleasant night had we been saved from these dervishes who entered a prosperous city and then ruined it.’ He recited:\\n\\nHow good it is when a powerful man forgives,\\n\\nParticularly when those forgiven have no helper.\\n\\nBy the sanctity of the love we share,\\n\\nDo not spoil what came first by what then follows it.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the porter had finished reciting these lines, the girl laughed…\\n': [0.6769086], 'Then, when it was the fifteenth night, SHE CONTINUED:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that, while the other guests waited, tied up with slaves standing by their heads with drawn swords, THE THIRD DERVISH SAID:\\n\\nI pronounced the Name of God and called on Him with supplication. Then, gripping the cracks in the rock, I gradually managed to climb up. At that point, by God’s permission, the wind died down and He helped me to make my way in safety until I reached the summit, where the only path that I could take led to the dome. I went in and then performed the ritual ablution as well as two rak‘as in gratitude to God for bringing me to safety, after which I fell asleep under its shelter. In my sleep, I heard a voice saying: ‘Ibn Khadib, when you wake, dig beneath your feet and you will find a bow of brass with three lead arrows, on which are inscribed talismans. Take the bow and the arrows and shoot the rider on top of the dome, for in this way you will rescue people from great distress. When you shoot him, he will fall into the sea and the bow will drop at your feet. Take it and bury it where you found it, and when you do this the sea will swell higher and higher, until it comes level with the mountain top. A little boat will then come up in which will be a man of brass – but not the one whom you shot. He will come to you with an oar in his hand and you must board his boat, but you are not to pronounce the Name of Almighty God. The man will row you for ten days and bring you to the Sea of Safety, where you will find someone to take you back to your own land, but all this will happen only if you do not mention the Name of God.’\\n\\nWhen I awoke, I got up eagerly and did what the voice had told me. I shot the horseman and when he fell into the sea, the bow dropped at my feet and I took it and buried it. The sea then stirred and rose higher until it was level with me on the mountain, and before I had waited long, I saw a little boat making its way towards me, at which I called down praises on Almighty God. When it arrived, I found in it a man of brass with a lead tablet on his breast, inscribed with names and talismans. I boarded it silently, without speaking, and the brass sailor rowed day after day for the full ten days. Then, looking out, to my great joy, I saw the Islands of Safety. Because of the intensity of my joy, I invoked the Name of God, reciting the formula: ‘There is no god but God,’ and crying: ‘Allahu akbar!’ As soon as I did this, the boat tipped me into the sea and then itself overturned.\\n\\nI knew how to swim, however, and so I swam all that day until nightfall, by which time my arms could no longer support me and my shoulders were tired. Exhausted and in mortal danger, I recited the confession of faith, being sure that I was about to die. A violent wind stirred up the sea and I was carried on by a wave as big as a castle, which hurled me on to the land in accordance with God’s will. I climbed up on the shore, where I squeezed out my wet clothes, spreading them out on the ground to dry overnight. The next morning, I put them on and went to see where I could walk. I came to a valley, only to discover, after walking round the edge of it, that I was on a small island surrounded by sea. ‘Every time that I escape from one predicament,’ I said to myself, ‘I fall into another that is worse.’\\n\\nWhile I was thinking over my plight and wishing that I was dead, at a distance I caught sight of a ship with people on it which was making for my island. I got up and sat in a tree, and from there I saw that the ship had come to land, and out of it emerged ten black slaves, each carrying a spade. They walked to the centre of the island where they dug until they had uncovered a trapdoor, which they raised up. They then went back to the ship and returned with bread, flour, butter, honey, sheep and utensils that someone living in the underground chamber would need. The slaves kept on going to and fro from the ship until they had moved all its cargo to the chamber. They then came back bringing the very finest of clothes and in the middle of them was a very old man, a skeletal figure, crushed by Time and worn away. He was wearing a tattered blue robe through which the winds blew west and east, as the poet has said:\\n\\nWhat shudders are produced by Time,\\n\\nAnd Time is strong and violent!\\n\\nI used to walk without weakness,\\n\\nBut now I am weak and cannot walk.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old man’s hand was being held by a youth cast in the mould of splendour and perfection to the extent that his beauty deserved to be proverbial. He was like a tender branch, enchanting every heart with his grace and enslaving all minds with his coquetry. As the poet has said:\\n\\nBeauty was brought to be measured against him,\\n\\nBut bowed its head in shame.\\n\\nIt was asked: ‘Have you seen anything like this,\\n\\nBeauty?’ It answered: ‘No.’\\n\\n\\n\\nThey walked on, lady, until they reached the underground chamber and went down into it. They stayed out of sight for an hour or more, and then the slaves and the old man came up, but the youth was not with them. They closed the door of the chamber as it had been before, after which they got into the boat and sailed out of sight. I climbed down from my tree and walked to the pile of earth, where I excavated the soil, removed it and worked patiently until I had cleared it all away. There was the trapdoor, made of wood and as big as a millstone. When I lifted it, I could see under it, to my astonishment, a vaulted stone staircase. Down this I went until I reached the bottom and there I found a clean chamber furnished with rugs and silks in which the youth was sitting on a raised dais, leaning back against a round cushion, holding a fan in his hand, with nosegays and scented herbs set before him. He was alone and when he saw me, he turned pale. I greeted him and said: ‘Calm yourself; don’t be alarmed. I mean you no harm. I am a mortal like you, and the son of a king, who has been brought to you by fate to cheer you in your loneliness. What is your story and how is it that you come to be living alone underground?’\\n\\nWhen he was sure that I was a man like himself, his colour returned and he let me approach him. Then he said: ‘My brother, my story is a strange one. My father is a merchant jeweller, who engages in trade, with slaves, black and white, acting for him, sailing to the furthest of lands with his goods, travelling with camels and carrying vast stores of wealth. He had never had a son, but then in a dream he saw that, although he would have one, this son would be short-lived. He woke in the morning after his dream, crying and weeping, and it was on the following night that my mother conceived me, a date that my father noted. When the period of her pregnancy ended, she gave birth to me, to his delight. He gave banquets and fed the mendicants and the poor because, so near the end of his life, he had been granted this gift. Then he summoned all the astrologers and astronomers, the sages and those who could cast a horoscope. They investigated my horoscope and told my father: “Your son will live for fifteen years, after which he will be faced by a danger, but if he escapes, his life will be a long one. The cause of his death will be as follows. In the Sea of Destruction is the Magnetic Mountain on top of which stands a horse of brass with a rider on whose chest is a lead tablet. Fifty days after this rider falls from his horse, your son will die, killed by the man who shoots the rider, his name being ‘Ajib ibn Khadib.” This caused my father great distress, but he gave me the best of upbringings until I reached the age of fifteen. Then, ten days ago, he heard that the rider had fallen into the sea and that the name of the man who had shot him was ‘Ajib, son of King Khadib. In his fear lest I be killed, my father brought me here. This is my story and this is why I am here all alone.’\\n\\nWhen I heard this, I was astonished and I said to myself: ‘I was the man who shot the rider, but by God I shall never kill this youth.’ Speaking aloud, I said: ‘Master, may you be preserved from disease and destruction, and if God Almighty wills it, you shall not see care, sorrow or confusion. I shall sit with you and serve you and then, having kept company with you throughout this period, I shall go on my way and you can take me to some of your mamluks, with whom I can travel back to my own lands.’ I sat talking to him until nightfall, when I got up, set light to a large candle and lit the lamps. After having brought out some food, we sat down to a meal, and we then ate some sweetmeats which I had produced. We sat talking until most of the night had passed, when the youth went to sleep. I put a covering over him and settled down to sleep myself.\\n\\nIn the morning, I got up, heated some water and gently woke my companion. When he was awake, I brought him the hot water and he washed his face and thanked me. ‘By God,’ he said, ‘when I am free from my present danger and safe from ‘Ajib ibn Khadib, I shall ask my father to reward you, but if I die, may my blessing be on you even so.’ I replied: ‘May there never be a day on which evil strikes you and may God will it that the day of my death comes before yours.’ I produced some food and we ate and I got him to perfume himself with incense. Then I made a draughts board for him and, after eating some sweetmeats, he and I started to play, going on until nightfall, when I got up, lit the lamps and brought out some more food. I sat talking to him until only a little was left of the night, when he fell asleep, after which I covered him up and slept myself. I went on doing this for a period of days and nights, becoming fond of him and forgetting my cares. ‘The astrologers lied,’ I said to myself, ‘for by God I shall never kill this boy.’\\n\\nI continued to serve him, to act as his companion and to talk with him for thirty-nine days until the night of the fortieth day. The youth was full of gladness and said to me: ‘Thanks be to God, my brother, Who has saved me from death, and this is because of your blessing and the blessing brought by your arrival. I pray that God may restore you to your own land.’ He then asked me to heat him water for a bath, which I willingly agreed to do. I warmed up a great quantity of water and brought it to him. He had a good bath, using lupin flour,* and I helped by rubbing him down and bringing him a change of clothes, after which I made up a high couch for him. He came and lay down to sleep there after his bath, saying: ‘Brother, cut me up a melon and dissolve some sugar in its juice.’ I went to the store cupboard and found a fine melon, which I put on a plate. ‘Master,’ I said to him, ‘do you have a knife?’ ‘It is on this high shelf above my head,’ he replied. So I got up quickly, took the knife and drew it from its sheath, but as I went back, I tripped. With the knife in my hand, I fell on top of the youth and, in accordance with the eternal decree, it quickly penetrated his heart and he died on the spot.\\n\\nWhen this happened and I realized that I had killed him, I uttered a loud cry, beat my face and tore my clothes, saying: ‘To God we belong and to Him do we return. O Muslims, this handsome youth had only a single night left of the dangerous period of forty days that the astrologers and sages had predicted for him, and his death came at my hands. How I wish I had not tried to cut this melon. This is an agonizing disaster, but it came about in order that God’s decree might be fulfilled.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.6750982], 'Then, when it was the eighth night, SHE CONTINUED:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that THE YOUNG MAN SAID:\\n\\nI struck the slave with the intention of cutting off his head but I had failed to sever his jugular and only cut his gullet, skin and flesh. He let out a loud snort and as my wife stirred, I stepped back, returned the sword to its sheath and went back to the city, where I entered the palace and lay down on my bed until morning. There was my wife coming to wake me, with her hair shorn, wearing mourning. She said: ‘Cousin, don’t object to what I am doing, as I have had news that my mother has died and that my father has been killed fighting the infidels, while one of my brothers has died of a fatal sting and the other of a fall. It is right for me to weep and grieve.’\\n\\nWhen I heard this, I did not tell her what I knew but said: ‘Do what you think proper and I shall not oppose you.’ From the beginning to the end of a whole year she remained miserable and in mourning, and then she said to me: ‘I want you to build me a tomb shaped like a dome beside your palace, which I shall set aside for grief and call the House of Sorrows.’ ‘Do as you please,’ I said, and she built her House of Sorrows, over which was a dome, covering what looked like a tomb. She brought the slave there and installed him in it, but he could no longer be of any service to her. He went on drinking wine, but since the day that I had wounded him he could no longer speak, and he was alive only because his allotted span had not yet come to an end. Every day, morning and evening, my wife would go to the tomb weeping and lamenting for him, and she would give him wine and broth.\\n\\nThings went on like this until it came to the second year. I had been long-suffering and had paid no attention to her, until one day, when I came to her room unexpectedly, I found her exclaiming tearfully: ‘Why are you absent from my sight, my heart’s delight? Talk to me, O my soul; speak to me, my darling.’ She recited:\\n\\nIf you have found consolation, love has left me no endurance.\\n\\nMy heart loves none but you.\\n\\nTake my bones and my soul with you wherever you may go,\\n\\nAnd where you halt, bury me opposite you.\\n\\nCall out my name over my grave and my bones will moan in answer,\\n\\nHearing the echo of your voice.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen she went on:\\n\\nMy wishes are fulfilled on the day I am near you,\\n\\nWhile the day of my doom is when you turn from me.\\n\\nI may pass the night in fear, threatened with destruction,\\n\\nBut union with you is sweeter to me than safety.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext she recited:\\n\\nIf every blessing and all this world were mine,\\n\\nTogether with the empire of the Persian kings,\\n\\nTo me this would not be worth a gnat’s wing,\\n\\nIf my eyes could not look on you.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she had finished speaking and weeping, I said to her: ‘Cousin, that is enough of sorrow, and more weeping will do you no good.’ ‘Do not try to stop me doing what I must do,’ she said, ‘for in that case, I shall kill myself.’ I said no more and left her to do what she wanted, and she went on grieving, weeping and mourning for a second year and then a third. One day, I went to her when something had put me out of temper and I was tired of the violence of her distress. I found her going towards the tomb beneath the dome, saying: ‘Master, I hear no word from you. Master, why don’t you answer me?’ Then she recited:\\n\\nGrave, grave, have the beloved’s beauties faded?\\n\\nAnd has the brightness and the radiance gone?\\n\\nGrave, you are neither earth nor heaven for me,\\n\\nSo how is it you hold both sun and moon?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I heard what she said and the lines she recited, I became even angrier than before and I exclaimed: ‘How long will this sorrow last?’ Then I recited myself:\\n\\nGrave, grave, has his blackness faded?\\n\\nAnd has the brightness and the foulness failed?\\n\\nGrave, you are neither basin nor a pot,\\n\\nSo how is it you hold charcoal and slime?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she heard this, she jumped up and said: ‘Damn you, you dog. It was you who did this to me and wounded my heart’s darling. You have caused me pain and robbed him of his youth, so that for three years he has been neither dead nor alive.’ To which I replied: ‘Dirty whore, filthiest of the fornicators and the prostitutes of black slaves, yes, it was I who did that.’ Then I drew my sword and aimed a deadly blow at her, but when she heard what I said and saw that I was intending to kill her, she burst out laughing and said: ‘Off, you dog! What is past cannot return and the dead cannot rise again, but God has given the man who did this to me into my power. Because of him there has been an unquenchable fire in my heart and a flame that cannot be hidden.’\\n\\nThen, as she stood there, she spoke some unintelligible words and added: ‘Through my magic become half stone and half man.’ It was then that I became as you see me now, unable to stand or to sit, neither dead nor alive. After this, she cast a spell over the whole city, together with its markets and its gardens. It had contained four different groups, Muslims, Christians, Jews and Magians, and these she transformed into fish – the white fish being the Muslims, the red the Magians, the blue the Christians and the yellow the Jews – and she transformed the four islands into four mountains that surround the pool. Every day she tortures me by giving me a hundred lashes with her whip until the blood flows down over my shoulders. Then she dresses me in a hair shirt of the kind that I am wearing on my upper half, over which she places this splendid gown.\\n\\nThe young man then wept and recited:\\n\\nO my God, I must endure Your judgement and decree,\\n\\nAnd if that pleases You, I shall do this.\\n\\nTyrants have wronged me and oppressed me here,\\n\\nBut Paradise may be my recompense.\\n\\nMy sufferings have left me in sad straits,\\n\\nBut God’s choice as His favoured Prophet intercedes for me.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe king then turned to the youth and said: ‘Although you have freed me from one worry, you have added another to my cares. Where is the woman and where is the tomb with the wounded slave?’ ‘He is lying in his tomb beneath the dome,’ said the young man, ‘and she is in that chamber opposite the door. She comes out once each day at sunrise, and the first thing she does is to strip me and give me a hundred lashes. I weep and call out but I cannot move to defend myself, and after she has tortured me, she takes wine and broth to the slave. She will come early tomorrow.’ ‘By God, young man,’ said the king, ‘I shall do you a service for which I shall be remembered and which will be recorded until the end of time.’ He then sat talking to him until nightfall, when they both slept.\\n\\nClose to dawn the king rose, stripped off his clothes, drew his sword and went to where the slave lay, surrounded by candles, lamps, perfumes and unguents. He came up to the slave and killed him with one blow, before lifting him on to his back and throwing him down a well in the palace. After that, he wrapped himself in the slave’s clothes and lay down in the tomb with the naked sword by his side. After an hour, the damned sorceress arrived, but before she entered the tomb, she first stripped her cousin of his clothes, took a whip and beat him. He cried out in pain: ‘The state that I am in is punishment enough for me, cousin; have pity on me.’ ‘Did you have pity on me,’ she asked, ‘and did you leave me, my beloved?’ She beat him until she was tired and the blood flowed down his sides; then she dressed him in a hair shirt under his robe, and went off to carry the slave a cup of wine and a bowl of broth.\\n\\nAt the tomb she wept and wailed, saying: ‘Master, speak to me; master, talk to me.’ She then recited:\\n\\nHow long will you turn away, treating me roughly?\\n\\nHave I not shed tears enough for you?\\n\\nHow do you intend abandoning me?\\n\\nIf your object is the envious, their envy has been cured.\\n\\n\\n\\nShedding tears, she repeated: ‘Master, talk to me.’ The king lowered his voice, twisted his tongue, and speaking in the accent of the blacks, he said: ‘Oh, oh, there is no might and no power except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent!’ When she heard this, she cried out with joy and then fainted. When she had recovered, she said: ‘Master, is this true?’ The king, in a weak voice, said: ‘You damned woman, do you deserve that anyone should talk to you or speak with you?’ ‘Why is that?’ she asked. ‘Because all day long you torture your husband, although he cries for help, and from dusk to dawn he stops me from sleeping as he calls out his entreaties, cursing both me and you. He disturbs me and harms me, and but for this I would have been cured. It is this that keeps me from answering you.’ ‘With your permission,’ she replied, ‘I shall release him.’ ‘Do that,’ said the king, ‘and allow me to rest.’ ‘I hear and obey,’ she replied and, after going from the tomb to the palace, she took a bowl, filled it with water and spoke some words over it. As the water boiled and bubbled, like a pot boiling on the fire, she sprinkled her husband with it and said: ‘I conjure you by the words that I have recited, if you are in this state because of my magic, revert from this shape to what you were before.’\\n\\nA sudden shudder ran through the young man and he rose to his feet, overjoyed at his release, calling out: ‘I bear witness that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Apostle of God – may God bless him and give him peace.’ His wife shouted at him, saying: ‘Go, and don’t come back, or else I shall kill you!’ He left her and she went back to the tomb, where she said: ‘Master, come out to me, so that I may see your beautiful form.’ In a weak voice the king replied: ‘What have you done? You have brought me relief from the branch but not from the root.’ ‘My beloved, my black darling,’ she said, ‘what is the root?’ ‘Curse you, you damned woman!’ he replied. ‘It is the people of the city and of the four islands. Every night at midnight the fish raise their heads asking for help and cursing me and you. It is this that stops my recovery. Go and free them quickly and then come back, take my hand and help me to get up, for I am on the road to recovery.’\\n\\nOn hearing these words and thinking that he was the slave, the sorceress was delighted and promised in God’s Name willingly to obey his command. She got up and ran joyfully to the pool, from which she took a little water…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.6655177], 'Then, when it was the sixteenth night, SHE CONTINUED:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that THE DERVISH TOLD THE LADY OF THE HOUSE:\\n\\nWhen I knew for certain that I had killed him, I got up, climbed the stairs and replaced the soil. Then I looked out to sea and caught sight of the ship making for the shore. I said fearfully: ‘Now they will come and find the boy dead. They will know that it was I who killed him and they will be bound to kill me.’ I made for a high tree, which I climbed, concealing myself among the leaves, and scarcely had I settled there than the black slaves and the youth’s old father disembarked and went towards the hidden chamber. They cleared away the earth, found the trap-door and went down. There they found the youth apparently asleep, his face glowing with the effect of his bath, dressed in clean clothes but with the knife plunged into his breast. They shrieked, wept, struck their faces, wailing and lamenting. The old man fainted for so long that the slaves thought that he would not survive his son. They wrapped the corpse of the youth in his clothes, covered him in a silken sheet and returned to the boat. Behind them came the old man, but when he saw his son laid out, he fell to the ground, poured earth on his head, struck his face and plucked out his beard, while the thought that his son had been killed caused his tears to flow faster and he fainted again. One of the slaves got up and spread a piece of silk on a couch, upon which they laid the old man and then sat by his head.\\n\\nWhile all this was going on, I was in the tree above them, watching what was happening. Because of the cares and sorrows that I had suffered, my heart turned grey before my hair and I recited:\\n\\nHow many hidden acts of grace does God perform\\n\\nWhose secrets are too subtle to be grasped by clever men?\\n\\nHow often in the morning trouble comes,\\n\\nWhile in the evening follows joy?\\n\\nHow many times does hardship turn to ease,\\n\\nAs pleasure follows the sad heart’s distress?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe old man did not recover from his swoon until it was close to evening. Then, looking at the body of his son, he saw that what he had feared had come to pass. He slapped his face and his head and recited these lines:\\n\\nThe loved ones left me with a broken heart,\\n\\nAnd floods of tears rain from my eyes.\\n\\nMy longing is for what lies distant, but, alas,\\n\\nHow can I reach this? What can I say or do?\\n\\nI wish that I had not set eyes on them.\\n\\nWhat can I do, my masters, in these narrow paths?\\n\\nHow can I find my solace in forgetfulness?\\n\\nThe blazing fire of love plays with my heart.\\n\\nI wish we had been joined by death\\n\\nIn an inseparable link.\\n\\nIn God’s Name, slanderer, go slow;\\n\\nJoin me with them while this can still be done.\\n\\nHow pleasantly we were sheltered by one roof,\\n\\nLiving a life of constant ease, until\\n\\nArrows of separation struck and parted us.\\n\\nAnd who is there with power to endure them?\\n\\nA blow struck us through the dearest of all men,\\n\\nPerfect in beauty, unique in his age.\\n\\nI called him – but the silent voice preceded me.\\n\\nMy son, would that your fate had not arrived.\\n\\nHow may I rush to ransom you, my son,\\n\\nWith my own life, were that acceptable?\\n\\nI say: he is the sun, and the sun sets.\\n\\nI say: he is the moon, and moons decline.\\n\\nThe days bring sorrow and distress for you.\\n\\nI cannot do without you. None can take your place.\\n\\nYour father longs for you, but you are dead,\\n\\nAnd he is helpless. The envious look at us today\\n\\nTo see what they have done; how evil was their deed!\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that, with a deep sigh his soul parted from his body. ‘O master,’ cried the slaves, and, pouring dust on their heads, they wept more and more bitterly. Then they put his body on the ship beside that of his son and, unfurling the sail, they passed out of sight. I came down from the tree, went through the trapdoor and thought about the youth. Seeing some of his belongings, I recited:\\n\\nI see their traces and so melt with longing,\\n\\nWeeping in places where they used to dwell.\\n\\nI ask God, Who decreed that they should leave,\\n\\nThat one day He may grant that they return?\\n\\n\\n\\nI then went out and passed my time wandering around the island by day and going into the underground chamber by night. In this way a month went by and, as I looked out over the western tip of the island, I could see that with every day that passed the water was drying up. Eventually there was very little of it left to the west and there was no longer any current. By the end of the month, to my joy, the sea had dried up in that direction and, sure that I was now safe, I got up and waded through what water was left until I reached the mainland. There I encountered sand dunes in which camels would sink up to their hocks, but, steeling myself, I managed to cross them, and then far off I caught a glimpse of a fire burning brightly. I made for it, hoping to find relief. Meanwhile I recited:\\n\\nIt may perhaps be that Time will direct its reins\\n\\nTowards some good – but Time is envious.\\n\\nWere it to aid hopes and fulfil my needs,\\n\\nIt might bring pleasure after this distress.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen my course brought me nearer, I saw a palace with a door of brass which, when the sun shone on it, gleamed from a distance like fire. I was delighted at the sight and sat down opposite the door. Scarcely had I taken my seat when there came towards me ten young men, wearing splendid clothes, with a very old companion. All the young men had lost their right eyes, and I was astonished by their appearance and at this coincidence. When they saw me they greeted me and asked me about myself and about my story. They were amazed when I told them what had happened to me and of my misfortunes, and they then brought me into the palace. Ranged around the hall were ten couches, each spread with and covered in blue material. In the middle of these was a small couch whose coverings, like those of the others, was also blue.\\n\\nWhen we entered the room, each of the young men went to his own couch and the old man went to the small one in the middle. He told me to sit down, but warned me not to ask questions about him and his companions or why they were one-eyed. He then brought food for each man in one container and drink in another and he did the same for me. After that, they sat asking me about my circumstances and my adventures, and their questions and my replies took up most of the night. Then they said: ‘Shaikh, bring us our due.’ ‘Willingly,’ the old man replied, and after going away into a closet, he came back carrying on his head ten trays, each with a covering of blue, and gave one to each of the young men. Then he lit ten candles, fixing one to each tray, and removed the covers. There beneath the covers on the trays was nothing but ashes and grime from cooking pots. All the young men rolled up their sleeves and, with tears and sobs, they smeared and slapped their faces, tore their clothes and beat their breasts, saying: ‘We were seated at our ease but our inquisitiveness did not leave us.’ They went on doing this until it was nearly morning, when the old man got up and heated water for them with which they washed their faces before putting on fresh clothes.\\n\\nWhen I saw this, I said: ‘I am astonished, amazed and afire with curiosity.’ I forgot what had happened to me and, unable to keep silent, I asked them: ‘Why have you done this, after we had become pleasantly tired? You are men of sound minds – praise be to God – and it is only madmen who act like this. I implore you by what you hold dearest to tell me your story and why you have lost your eyes and why you smear your faces with ashes and grime.’ They turned to me and said: ‘Young man, do not be led astray by your youth and do not press your question.’ Then they got up and so did I, after which the old man brought out food, and when we had eaten and the plates had been removed, they sat talking until nightfall. The old man then rose and lit candles and lamps, before bringing us food and drink.\\n\\nWe sat talking in a friendly way to one another until midnight. ‘Bring us our due,’ they then told the old man, ‘as it is time for sleep.’ He brought the trays with the black ashes and they did what they had done on the first night. The same thing went on for a whole month while I stayed with them, as every night they would smear their faces with ashes before washing them and then changing their clothes. I was astonished at this and became more and more uneasy, to the extent that I could neither eat nor drink. ‘Young men,’ I said, ‘you must satisfy my concern and tell me why it is that you smear your faces.’ They said: ‘It is better to keep our secret hidden,’ but as I was too perplexed to eat or drink, I insisted that they tell me. ‘This will go hard with you,’ they replied, ‘as you will become like us.’ ‘There is no help for it,’ I said, ‘unless you allow me to leave you and go back to my family, so that I may no longer have to watch all this. As the proverb has it, it is better for me to be far away from you, for what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve over.’ At this, they took a ram, slaughtered it and skinned it, then told me to take a knife, wrap the skin around me and sew it up. They went on: ‘A bird called a rukh will swoop on you and lift you up, before setting you down on a mountain, where you should slit open the skin and come out. The bird will be scared away from you and will go off, leaving you alone. Walk on for half a day and you will find in front of you a strange-looking palace. Enter it and you will have achieved what you wanted, as it was because we went into it that we blacken our faces and each of us has lost an eye. It would take a long time to explain all this, as each of us has a tale to tell of how his right eye was plucked out.’\\n\\nI was pleased when I heard this, and after I had done what they had instructed, the bird came and carried me off, leaving me on the mountain top. I got out of the skin and walked on until I reached the palace, where I found forty girls, beautiful as moons, at whom no one could tire of looking. On seeing me, they all greeted me warmly. ‘We have been expecting you for a month,’ they said, ‘and praise be to God Who has brought us one who deserves us and whom we deserve.’ They seated me on a high dais and said: ‘Today you are our lord and master and we are your slave girls, under your command, so give us your orders.’ I was astonished by all this, but they brought me food and we ate together, after which they fetched drink. They clustered around me and five of them spread out a mat around which they set out quantities of scented flowers, together with fruits, fresh and dried. Then they brought wine and we sat down to drink as they sang to the music of the lute.\\n\\nThe wine circulated and such was my delight that I forgot all worldly cares. ‘This is the life,’ I said, and I stayed with them until it was time to sleep. ‘Take whichever of us you choose to sleep with you,’ they said. So I took one of them, with a beautiful face, dark eyes, black hair, well-spaced teeth, perfect in all aspects, with joining eyebrows, like a supple bough or a sprig of sweet basil, astonishing and amazing the mind. As the poet has said:\\n\\nIt shows ignorance to compare her to a tender branch,\\n\\nAnd how far is she unlike a gazelle!\\n\\nHow can the dear gazelle have a form like hers\\n\\nOr honeyed lips like hers – how sweet a drink –\\n\\nOr her wide eyes, that act as murderers,\\n\\nCapturing the desperate lover, tortured and then slain?\\n\\nI yearn for her; mine is a heathen love;\\n\\nNo wonder that the lovesick is in love.\\n\\n\\n\\nI recited to her:\\n\\nMy eyes see nothing but your loveliness;\\n\\nApart from you no thought enters my heart,\\n\\nFor every thought of mine is fixed on you;\\n\\nIn your love is my death and my rebirth.\\n\\n\\n\\nI then got up and spent a night of unsurpassed pleasure sleeping with her. In the morning, the girls took me to the baths, washed me and gave me the most splendid of clothes to wear. Then they brought out food and drink and we ate and drank, the wine circulating until nightfall. This time I chose another lovely, pliant girl. As the poet describes:\\n\\nI saw upon her breast two caskets sealed with musk,\\n\\nWithheld from any lover’s grasp,\\n\\nGuarded with arrows she shoots from her eyes –\\n\\nArrows that strike down any who attack.\\n\\n\\n\\nI passed the most delightful of nights, sleeping with her until dawn. In short, my lady, I spent a whole year with these girls, enjoying a carefree life, but as the next year began, they said: ‘Would that we had never known you, but if you listen to us you can save yourself.’ They then started to weep and when I asked them what the matter was, they explained: ‘We are the daughters of kings, and we have been gathered together here for a period of years. We go away for forty days and then stay here for a year, eating, drinking, enjoying ourselves and taking our pleasure, after which we go off again. This is our custom and we are afraid that when we leave you, you will not do what we tell you. Here are the keys of the palace, which we are handing over to you. In the palace are forty rooms, thirty-nine of which you may enter, but you must take care not to open the door of the fortieth, or else you will be forced to leave us.’ ‘If that is so,’ I said, ‘then I shall certainly not open it.’\\n\\nOne of them then came to me, embraced me, wept and recited the lines:\\n\\nIf after separation we come close again,\\n\\nThe frown upon Time’s face will turn into a smile.\\n\\nIf a sight of you serves as kohl for my eyes,\\n\\nI shall forgive Time all its evil deeds.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen I recited:\\n\\nWhen she came close to say farewell, she and her heart\\n\\nWere allies there to longing and to love.\\n\\nShe wept moist pearls, while my tears, as they flowed,\\n\\nWere like carnelians, forming a necklace on her breast.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn seeing the girls’ tears, I swore that I would never open the forbidden room, and after I had said goodbye, they went outside and flew away. So I sat in the palace by myself and when evening approached, I opened the door to the first chamber and went in. There I found a virtual paradise, a garden with green trees, ripe fruits, tuneful birds and gushing waters. I felt at rest as I walked among the trees, smelling sweet-scented flowers and listening to the song of the birds as they glorified the One God, the Omnipotent. I looked at apples whose colour was midway between red and yellow, as the poet has said:\\n\\nAn apple’s nature has combined two shades –\\n\\nThe beloved’s cheek and the complexion of the timorous lover.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen I looked at quinces that put to shame the scent of musk and ambergris, as the poet has said:\\n\\nWithin the quince are all mankind’s delights;\\n\\nIts fame surpasses every other fruit.\\n\\nIts taste is wine and its scent diffused musk,\\n\\nGolden in colour, shaped like the full moon.\\n\\n\\n\\nI then looked at apricots whose beauty delighted the eye like polished rubies, and after that I left the chamber and locked the door again. Next day I opened the door to the second chamber, went in and found a large space, with date palms and a flowing stream whose banks were carpeted with rose bushes, jasmine, marjoram, eglantine, narcissus and gillyflowers. Breezes passed over these scented flowers and the scent spread in all directions, filling me with perfect happiness. I left this chamber, locked the door behind me and opened the third. Here I found a hall, paved with coloured marble, valuable minerals and precious stones. In it were cages of sandalwood and aloes wood, with singing birds, such as the nightingale, the ringdove, blackbirds, turtledoves and the Nubian song thrush. I was delighted by this; my cares were dispelled and I slept there until morning. Then I opened the fourth door to discover a large chamber with forty closets whose doors were standing open. I went in and saw an indescribable quantity of pearls, sapphires, topazes, emeralds and other precious stones. In my astonishment I exclaimed: ‘I do not think that there is a single king who has all this in his treasury.’ Joy filled me, my cares leaving me, and I said: ‘I am the supreme ruler of the age; my wealth is a gift granted me by God’s grace; the forty girls are under my authority, and they have no other man besides me.’ I went from place to place until thirty-nine days had passed, during which time I had opened all the rooms except for the one whose door I had been told not to open.\\n\\nThis one, which made the number up to forty, preoccupied me and, in order to bring me misery, Satan incited me to open it. I could not hold out against this, and so with only one day left before the girls were due to return, I went to the chamber, opened the door and went in. I found a fragrance the like of which I had never smelt before. It overcame my senses and I fell down in a faint, which lasted for an hour. Then I plucked up my courage and went further into the room, whose floor I found spread with saffron. Light was given by lamps of gold and candles from which was diffused the scent of musk and ambergris, and I saw two huge censers, each filled with aloes wood, ambergris and honeyed perfume whose scent filled the room. I saw a horse, black as darkest night, in front of which was a manger of clear crystal, filled with husked sesame, together with a similar manger filled with rosewater scented with musk. The horse was harnessed and bridled and its saddle was of red gold.\\n\\nWhen I saw this, I was astonished and said to myself: ‘There must be something of great importance here.’ Satan led me further astray and so I took hold of the horse and mounted it. It didn’t move and so I kicked it, and when it still refused to move, I took the whip and struck it. As soon as it felt the blow, it neighed with a sound like rumbling thunder and, opening up a pair of wings, it flew off with me, carrying me up into the sky way above the ground. After a time, it set me down on a flat roof and whisked its tail across my face, striking out my right eye and causing it to slide down my cheek. It then left me and I came down from the roof to find the ten one-eyed youths. ‘No welcome to you,’ they said. ‘Here I am,’ I replied. ‘I have become like you, and I want you to give me a tray of grime with which to blacken my face and to let me sit with you.’ ‘No, by God,’ they said, ‘you may not do that. Get out!’\\n\\nThey drove me away, leaving me in dire straits, thinking over the misfortunes that had overtaken me. I was sad at heart and tearful when I parted from them, and I said to myself in a low voice: ‘I was resting at my ease, but my inquisitiveness would not leave me.’ So I shaved off my beard and whiskers and wandered from place to place. God decreed that I should remain safe and I reached Baghdad yesterday evening, where I found these two men standing in perplexity. I greeted them and introduced myself as a stranger. ‘We too are strangers,’ they said, so we agreed to go together, all of us being dervishes and all being blind in the right eye. This, lady, is why I am clean shaven and have lost my eye.\\n\\n‘You can touch your forelock and go,’ she told him, but he replied: ‘Not before I have heard what these other people have to say.’\\n\\nThe lady of the house then turned to the caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur and said: ‘Tell me your story.’ Ja‘far came forward and told her the story that he had told to the doorkeeper when they entered and when she heard this, she allowed them all to leave. In the lane outside, the caliph asked the dervishes where they were proposing to go as dawn had not yet broken. When they said that they did not know, he told them to come and spend the night with him. ‘Take them,’ he said to Ja‘far, ‘and bring them to me in the morning, so that we may write down what has happened.’ Ja‘far did as he was told and the caliph went up to his palace, but found himself unable to sleep that night.\\n\\nIn the morning, he took his seat on the imperial throne, and when his officials had assembled, he turned to Ja‘far and told him to bring the three ladies, the two bitches and the three dervishes. Ja‘far got up and brought them all, the ladies being veiled. Ja‘far turned to them and said: ‘You are forgiven because of your earlier kindness, although you did not know who we were. I can tell you now that you are standing before the fifth of the caliphs of the Banu ‘Abbas, Harun al-Rashid, the brother of Musa al-Hadi and son of al-Mahdi Muhammad, the son of Abu Ja‘far al-Mansur, the son of Muhammad, the brother of al-Saffah, son of Muhammad. You are to tell nothing but the truth.’\\n\\nWhen the ladies heard what Ja‘far had said as spokesman for the Commander of the Faithful, the eldest of them came forward and said to the caliph: ‘Commander of the Faithful, mine is a story which, were it written with needles on the inner corners of the eyeballs of mankind, would serve as a warning to those who take heed and counsel to those who profit from counsel.’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.66365474], 'Then, when it was the nineteenth night, SHE CONTINUED:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that the caliph ordered their story to be written down in the records and placed in the royal archives. He then asked the first girl: ‘Have you any news of the jinn lady who bewitched your sisters?’ ‘Commander of the Faithful,’ she replied, ‘she gave me a lock of her hair and told me that when I wanted her I should burn a single hair and she would come quickly, even if she were on the far side of Mount Qaf.’ The caliph asked her to produce the lock of hair, which she did, and he then took a single strand and burned it. When the smell of the burning spread, the palace was rocked by a tremor; there was a sound like a peal of thunder and there stood the lady. As she was a Muslim, she greeted the caliph, who replied: ‘Peace be on you and the mercy and blessings of God.’ ‘Know,’ she went on, ‘that this girl sowed the seed of gratitude for a good deed that she did me, for which I could not repay her, when she saved me from death and killed my enemy. I then saw what her sisters had done to her. At first I wanted to kill them but I was afraid that this might distress her, so then I thought that I should take revenge by turning them by magic into dogs. If you now want them to be set free, Commander of the Faithful, I shall release them as a favour to you and to her, for I am a Muslim.’ ‘Do so,’ he said, ‘and after that I shall begin to investigate the affair of the girl who was beaten. If it turns out that she was telling the truth, we shall avenge her on whoever wronged her.’\\n\\n‘Commander of the Faithful,’ said the lady, ‘I shall release the two and then tell you who it was who wronged this girl and seized her wealth – someone who is your closest relation.’ She then took a bowl of water, cast a spell over it and recited some unintelligible words. She sprinkled water on the faces of the two bitches and said: ‘Return to your former shapes as humans,’ which they did. ‘Commander of the Faithful,’ she then said, ‘the young man who beat the girl is your own son, al-Amin, the brother of al-Ma’mun. He had heard of her great beauty and set a trap for her. But he married her legally and was within his rights to beat her, as he had imposed a condition on her and got her to swear a solemn oath that she would do nothing to break it. Break it she did, however, and he was going to kill her, but for fear of God he beat her instead and sent her back to her own house. This is the story of the second girl, but God knows better.’\\n\\nWhen the caliph heard what she had to say and learned how the girl had come to be beaten, he was filled with astonishment and said: ‘Glory be to God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent, Who has granted me the favour of learning this girl’s history and rescued these two others from sorcery and torture. By God, I shall do something that will be recorded after me.’ Then he had his son al-Amin brought before him and he questioned him about the second girl, questions to which al-Amin returned a truthful answer. He then brought in qadis and notaries, as well as the three dervishes, together with the first girl and her two sisters who had been bewitched. He married the three of them to the three dervishes, who had told him that they were kings, and whom he now appointed as chamberlains at his court, giving them all they needed and assigning them allowances, as well as lodgings in the palace of Baghdad. He returned the girl who had been beaten to his son al-Amin, renewing their marriage contract, giving her a great store of wealth and ordering that their house should be rebuilt with the greatest splendour. He himself married the housekeeper and slept with her that night and in the morning he gave her a chamber of her own among his concubines, together with slave girls to serve her and regular allowances. The people were astonished at his magnanimity, generosity and wisdom. His orders were that all these stories should be written down.\\n\\nDunyazad said to her sister: ‘Shahrazad, by God, no one has heard so fine and pleasant a story, but tell me another to pass what remains of this wakeful night.’ ‘Willingly,’ Shahrazad replied, ‘if the king gives me leave.’ ‘Tell your story at once,’ he said, AND SHE BEGAN:\\n\\nIt is said, king of the age and lord of our times, that one night the caliph Harun al-Rashid summoned his vizier Ja‘far and said: ‘I want to go down into the city to ask the common people about the governors who have charge of them, so as to depose any of whom they complain and promote those to whom they are grateful.’ ‘To hear is to obey,’ replied Ja‘far.\\n\\nSo the caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur left the palace and made their way through the city, walking in the markets and streets until they passed a lane. There they saw a very old man carrying on his head a fishing net and a basket, and holding a stick in his hand. He was walking slowly and reciting:\\n\\nThey said to me: ‘Among mankind\\n\\nYou with your wisdom are a moonlit night.’\\n\\nI said: ‘Do not say this to me;\\n\\nThere is no wisdom without power.\\n\\nWere they to try to pawn me and my wisdom,\\n\\nTogether with my books and my inkstand,\\n\\nFor one day’s worth of food, it would not work\\n\\nAnd such a bargain would be thought contemptible.\\n\\nThe poor, their state, their life,\\n\\nHow dark they are with troubles!\\n\\nIn summer they cannot find food, and in the cold\\n\\nThey have to warm themselves over a brazier.\\n\\nStreet dogs attack them and they are the butt\\n\\nOf every despicable man.\\n\\nWhen one of them complains about his lot,\\n\\nThere is none to excuse him among all mankind\\n\\nSuch is the life of the poor man;\\n\\nIt will be best for him when he is in his grave.’\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the caliph heard what the man was reciting, he said to Ja‘far: ‘Look at this man and note his verses, which show that he is in need.’ The caliph then went up to the man and said: ‘Shaikh, what is your craft?’ ‘I am a fisherman,’ he replied. ‘I left home at midday, but up till now God has not provided me with anything with which I can feed my family. I am tired of life and I wish that I were dead.’ ‘Would you go back with us to the Tigris, stand on the bank and trust in my luck as you cast your net. Whatever comes up I will buy for a hundred dinars.’ When he heard this, the old man agreed with delight. He went with the three of them back to the river, cast his net and waited before pulling in the cord and dragging it in. Up it came with a heavy, locked chest. The caliph looked at the chest, handled it and noted its weight, after which he gave the fisherman his hundred dinars, and the man went off.\\n\\nThe caliph himself then left, accompanied by Masrur, who was carrying the chest, and they brought it up to the palace. Candles were lit and after the chest had been placed in front of the caliph, Ja‘far and Masrur came forward and broke it open. In it they found a basket of palm leaves sewn up with threads of red wool, and after they had cut this open, they found a carpet. When they had lifted this out, they discovered a shawl and wrapped in this was a girl like a silver ingot, who had been killed and cut in pieces – a sight that so distressed the caliph that his tears flowed over his cheeks. He turned to Ja‘far and said: ‘Dog of a vizier, are people to be murdered and thrown into the river during my reign, so that I am to be held responsible for them on the Day of Judgement? By God, I must make the murderer pay for this girl’s death and I shall put him to the most cruel of deaths.’ He then told Ja‘far in his furious rage: ‘It is as true as is my descent from the ‘Abbasid caliphs that if you do not produce the murderer for my justice, I will hang you at the palace gate together with forty of your cousins.’\\n\\nBefore leaving his presence, Ja‘far asked for a three-day delay, which the caliph granted. He then went down sadly into the city, saying to himself: ‘How can I find out who killed this girl and bring him to the caliph? If I bring the wrong person, I shall be held responsible for him. I don’t know what to do.’ For three days, he sat at home and on the fourth the caliph sent a chamberlain to fetch him. When he came to the caliph and was asked where the murderer was, he said: ‘Commander of the Faithful, am I the monitor of murder victims that I should know who killed the girl?’ The caliph was enraged and gave orders that he should be hanged below the palace. A town crier was ordered to call out in the streets of Baghdad: ‘Whoever wants to see the hanging of Ja‘far the Barmecide, the caliph’s vizier, and the hanging of his Barmecide cousins at the palace gate, let him come to watch.’ People came out from all quarters of the city to see the execution, although they did not know why the Barmecides were being hanged. The gallows were set up and the victims were made to stand beneath.\\n\\nThe executioners were waiting for the agreed signal from the caliph and the crowd was weeping for Ja‘far and his cousins. At this point, however, out came a young man – handsome, well dressed, with a face bright as the moon, dark eyes, radiant forehead, red cheeks and a mole like a disc of ambergris. He cleared a way for himself through the people and kept on until he stood before Ja‘far. ‘Lord of the emirs and shelterer of the poor,’ he said, ‘you are saved from this plight. The killer of the murdered girl whom you found in the chest is I, so hang me in retaliation for her death and take revenge for her on me.’\\n\\nWhen Ja‘far heard this, he was glad that he himself had escaped death, but he felt sorry for the young man. While they were talking, an old man, stricken in years, made his way through the crowd until he reached the two of them. He greeted them and said: ‘My lord, great vizier, don’t believe what this young man says. No one but I killed the girl, so avenge her death on me; if you do not, I will demand justice from you in the presence of Almighty God.’ ‘Vizier,’ said the youth, ‘this is the maundering of an old man who doesn’t know what he is saying. It was I and I alone who killed her, so make me pay for her death.’ ‘My son,’ said the old man, ‘you are young and this world is still attractive to you, while I am old and have had my fill of it. I shall give my life to ransom you and I shall ransom the vizier and his cousins, for I killed the girl and I conjure you by God to hang me quickly, as there is no life for me now that she is dead.’\\n\\nThe vizier was astonished to see what was happening and he took the young man and the old one to the caliph. He kissed the ground and said: ‘Commander of the Faithful, I have brought you the murderer of the girl.’ ‘Which is he?’ asked the caliph. ‘This young man says that he killed her, while the old man here says that that is a lie and that he himself is the killer. Here are the two of them before you.’ The caliph looked at them and asked: ‘Which of you did kill her?’ ‘I did,’ said the young man. ‘I am the killer,’ protested the old man. ‘Take the two of them,’ said the caliph to Ja‘far, ‘and hang them both.’ ‘If only one of them killed her,’ said Ja‘far, ‘then to hang the other would be unjust.’ The young man insisted: ‘By the truth of the One God Who raised up the heavens and spread out the earth, it was I who killed her and this was how she was killed.’ He described what the caliph had found, which made him sure that the young man was indeed the murderer.\\n\\nFilled with wonder at what the two had said, the caliph asked the young man: ‘Why was it that you unjustly killed this girl and what led you to confess to the murder without being beaten? Why did you come yourself just now to tell me to avenge her on you?’ THE YOUNG MAN REPLIED:\\n\\nYou must know, Commander of the Faithful, that this girl was my cousin and my wife, while this old man is her father and my uncle. I married her when she was a virgin and God gave me three sons by her. She used to love me and wait on me and I saw no fault in her, while I for my part loved her dearly. At the beginning of this month, she fell seriously ill, but I brought her doctors and gradually she got better. I wanted to take her to the baths but she said that before going, there was something that she wanted for which she had been longing. I said that I would willingly get it and asked what it was. ‘I have a longing for an apple,’ she said, ‘that I can smell and from which I can take a bite.’ I went straight away to the city and searched for apples, but I couldn’t find a single one to buy, even for a dinar. I went back home in distress and told my wife of my failure. This upset her; she had been weak before, and that night she became much weaker.\\n\\nI spent the night brooding over the problem and when morning came, I left my house and did the rounds of the orchards, one after the other, without finding any apples in them. Then I met an old gardener and, when I asked him, he told me: ‘There are few or no apples to be found, except in Basra, in the orchard of the Commander of the Faithful, where they are in the charge of his gardener who keeps them for his master.’ I went back home and my love and affection for my wife led me to make myself ready to set out on a journey to Basra. I travelled for fifteen days and nights there and back, bringing my wife three apples which I had bought from the gardener at Basra for one dinar each. I went in and gave them to her, but they gave her no pleasure and she put them aside. Her weakness and fever had grown worse and this went on for ten days, after which she recovered.\\n\\nI then left my house and went to my shop, where I sat buying and selling. At midday, while I was sitting there, a black slave passed by holding one of those three apples in his hand and playing with it. When I asked him about the apple, pretending that I wanted to get one like it, he laughed and told me that he had got it from his mistress. ‘I had been away,’ he explained, ‘and when I got back, I found her sick. She had three apples with her and she told me that her cuckold of a husband had gone to Basra for them and had bought them for three dinars. It was one of these that I took.’\\n\\nWhen I heard what the slave had to say, Commander of the Faithful, the world turned black for me. I got up, closed my shop and returned home, out of my mind with anger. Looking at the apples, I could see only two. ‘Where is the third?’ I asked my wife, and when she said: ‘I don’t know,’ I was certain that the slave had told me the truth, so I picked up a knife, and coming from behind her, without a word I knelt on her breast and slit her throat with the knife. Then I cut off her head and quickly put her in a basket, covering her with a shawl. I wrapped her in a piece of carpet, sewed the whole thing up and put it in a chest, which I locked. I then loaded it on to my mule and threw it with my own hands into the Tigris. In God’s Name, Commander of the Faithful, I implore you to hang me quickly, as I am afraid that my wife will demand restitution from me on the Day of Judgement. For when I had thrown her into the river without anyone knowing what I had done, I went back home and there I found my eldest son in tears, although he did not know what I had done to his mother. When I asked him why he was crying, he told me that he had taken one of his mother’s apples and had gone into the lane to play with his brothers. He said: ‘But a tall black slave snatched it from me and asked me where I had got it. I told him that my father had gone to Basra to bring it for my mother who was sick and that he had bought three apples for three dinars. The slave took the apple and paid no attention to me, even though I told him this a second and a third time, and then he hit me and went off with it. I was afraid that my mother would beat me because of it and so my brothers and I went off out of the city. Evening came and I was still afraid of what she might do to me. For God’s sake, father, don’t say anything to her that may make her ill again.’\\n\\nWhen I heard what the boy had to say, I realized that this slave was the one who had made up a lying story to hurt my wife and I was certain that I had killed her unjustly. While I was weeping bitterly, this old man, her father, arrived and, when I told him what had happened, he sat down beside me and wept. We went on weeping until midnight, and for five days until now we have been mourning her and regretting her unjust death. All the blame for this rests on the slave and it is he who is responsible for her death. I implore you, by your ancestors’ honour, to kill me quickly, as there is no life for me now she is dead. So avenge her death on me.\\n\\nWhen the caliph heard the young man’s story, he was filled with astonishment and said: ‘By God, I shall hang no one except this damned slave and I shall do a deed which will cure the sick and please the Glorious King.’\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.63953555], '\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen it was the fifth night, Dunyazad asked her sister to finish the story if she was not too sleepy, AND SHAHRAZAD SAID:\\n\\nI have heard, O fortunate king, that King Yunan accused his vizier of being jealous of Duban and wanting to have him killed. ‘Then after that I would regret it,’ Yunan added, ‘as King Sindbad regretted killing his falcon.’ ‘Excuse me, your majesty,’ said the vizier, ‘but how was that?’ YUNAN WENT ON:\\n\\nYou must know that there was a Persian king with a passion for enjoyment and amusement, who had a fondness for hunting. He had reared a falcon which was his constant companion by night and by day, and which would spend the night perched on his wrist. He would take it hunting with him and he had a golden bowl made for it which he hung round its neck and from which it could drink. One day the chief falconer came to where he was sitting and told him that it was time to go out hunting. The king gave the orders and went off with the falcon on his wrist until he and his party reached a wadi, where they spread out their hunting cordon. Trapped in this was a gazelle and the king threatened that anyone who allowed it to leap over his head would be put to death. When the cordon was narrowed, the gazelle came to where the king was posted, supported itself on its hindlegs and placed its forelegs on its chest as though it was kissing the ground before him. He bent his head towards it and it then jumped over him, making for the open country. He noticed that his men were looking at him and winking at each other and when he asked his vizier what this meant, the man explained: ‘They are pointing out that you said that if anyone let the gazelle jump over his head, he would be killed.’\\n\\nThe king then swore that he would hunt it down and he rode off in pursuit, following the gazelle until he came to a mountain. There it was about to pass through a cleft when the king loosed his falcon at it and the bird clawed at its eyes, blinding and dazing it, so that the king could draw his mace and knock it over with a single blow. He then dismounted and cut its throat, after which he skinned it and tied it to his saddlebow. As this was in the noonday heat and the region was desolate and waterless, both the king and his horse were thirsty by now. The king scouted round and discovered a tree from which what looked like liquid butter was dripping. Wearing a pair of kid gloves, he took the bowl from the falcon’s neck, filled it with this liquid and set it in front of the bird, but it knocked the bowl and overturned it. The king took it and filled it again, thinking that the falcon must be thirsty, but the same thing happened when he put it down a second time. This annoyed him and he went a third time to fill the bowl and take it to his horse, but this time the falcon upset it with its wing. The king cursed it, exclaiming: ‘You unluckiest of birds, you have stopped me drinking, and have stopped yourself and the horse.’ He then struck off its wing with a blow from his sword, but the bird raised its head as though to say by its gesture: ‘Look at the top of the tree.’ The king raised his eyes and what he saw there was a brood of vipers whose poison was dripping down. Immediately regretting what he had done, he mounted his horse and rode back to his pavilion, bringing with him the gazelle, which he handed to the cook, telling him to take it and roast it. As he sat on his chair with the falcon on his wrist, it drew its last breath and died, leaving its master to exclaim with sorrow for having killed it, when it had saved his life. So ends the story of King Sindbad.\\n\\n‘Great king,’ the vizier said, ‘Sindbad acted out of necessity and I can see nothing wrong in that. I myself am acting out of sympathy for you, so that you may realize that I am right, for otherwise you may meet the same fate as the vizier who schemed against the prince.’ ‘How was that?’ the king asked, AND THE VIZIER SAID:\\n\\nYou must know, your majesty, that there was a vizier in the service of a certain king with a son who was passionately fond of hunting. This vizier had been ordered to accompany the prince wherever he went, and so, when he went off to hunt one day, the vizier rode with him. While they were riding they caught sight of a huge beast and the vizier encouraged the prince to pursue it. The prince rode after it until he was out of sight and the beast then vanished into the desert, leaving the prince with no idea of where to go. Just then, ahead of him he saw a weeping girl and when he asked her who she was, she told him: ‘I am the daughter of one of the kings of India and while I was in this desert I became drowsy. Then, before I knew what was happening, I had fallen off my beast and was left alone, not knowing what to do.’\\n\\nWhen the prince heard this, he felt sorry for the girl and took her up behind him on the back of his horse. On his way, he passed a ruined building and the girl said she wanted to relieve herself. He set her down, but she was taking so long that he followed her, only to discover that, although he had not realized it, she was a female ghul and was telling her children: ‘I have brought you a fat young man today.’ ‘Fetch him to us, mother,’ they said, ‘so that we can swallow him down.’ On hearing this, the prince shuddered, fearing for his life and certain that he was going to die. He went back and the ghula came out and, seeing him panic-stricken and shivering, she asked why he was afraid. ‘I have an enemy whom I fear,’ he told her. ‘You call yourself a prince?’ she asked, and when he said yes, she went on: ‘Why don’t you buy him off with money?’ ‘He won’t accept money but wants my life,’ he told her, adding: ‘I am afraid of him and I have been wronged.’ ‘In that case, if what you say is true, then ask help from God,’ she said, ‘for He will protect you against your enemy’s evil and the evil that you fear from him.’ At that the prince lifted his head towards heaven and said: ‘God Who answers the prayers of those in distress when they call on You, and Who clears away evil, may You help me against my enemy and remove him from me, for You have power to do what You wish.’\\n\\nAfter hearing the prince’s prayer, the ghula left him. He went back to his father and when he told him about the vizier’s advice, his father summoned the man and had him killed. As for you, your majesty, if you put your trust in this sage, he will see to it that you die the worst of deaths, and it will be the man whom you have well treated and taken as a friend who will destroy you. Don’t you see that he cured your disease externally through something you held in your hand, so how can you be sure that he won’t kill you by something else you hold?\\n\\n‘What you say is right, vizier, my sound advisor,’ agreed the king, ‘for this man has come as a spy to destroy me and if he could cure me with something I held, it may be that he can kill me with something that I smell.’\\n\\nThen he asked the vizier what was to be done about Duban. The vizier said: ‘Send for him immediately, telling him to come here, and when he does, cut off his head and then you will be safe from any harm he may intend to do you. Betray him before he betrays you.’ The king agreed with the vizier, and sent for Duban, who came gladly, not knowing what God the Merciful had ordained. This was as the poet said:\\n\\nYou who fear your fate, be at your ease;\\n\\nEntrust your affairs to Him Who has stretched out the earth.\\n\\nWhat is decreed by fate will come about,\\n\\nAnd you are safe from what is not decreed.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuban the wise came into the presence of the king and recited:\\n\\nIf I do not show gratitude\\n\\nIn accordance with part, at least, of your deserts,\\n\\nTell me for whom I should compose my poetry and my prose.\\n\\nBefore I asked, you granted me\\n\\nFavours that came with no delay and no excuse.\\n\\nWhy then do I not give you your due of praise,\\n\\nLauding your generosity in secret and in public?\\n\\nI shall record the benefits you heaped on me,\\n\\nLightening my cares, but burdening my back.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe followed this with another poem:\\n\\nTurn aside from cares, entrusting your affairs to fate;\\n\\nRejoice in the good that will come speedily to you,\\n\\nSo that you may forget all that is past.\\n\\nThere is many a troublesome affair\\n\\nWhose aftermath will leave you in content.\\n\\nGod acts according to His will;\\n\\nDo not oppose your God.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe also recited:\\n\\nLeave your affairs to God, the Gentle, the Omniscient,\\n\\nAnd let your heart rest from all worldly care.\\n\\nKnow that things do not go as you wish;\\n\\nThey follow the decree of God, the King.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then recited:\\n\\nBe of good cheer, relax; forget your cares;\\n\\nCares eat away the resolute man’s heart.\\n\\nPlanning is no help to a slave who has no power.\\n\\nAbandon this and live in happiness.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe king asked him: ‘Do you know why I have sent for you?’ ‘No one knows what is hidden except for God,’ Duban replied. ‘I have sent for you,’ said the king, ‘in order to kill you and take your life.’ This astonished Duban, who said: ‘Why should you kill me, your majesty, and what is my crime?’ ‘I have been told that you are a spy,’ answered the king, ‘and that you have come to murder me. I am going to kill you before you can do the same to me.’ The king then called for the executioner and said: ‘Cut off this traitor’s head, so that we may be freed from his evil-doing.’ ‘Spare me,’ said Duban, ‘and God will spare you; do not kill me, lest He kill you.’\\n\\nHe then repeated what I repeated to you, ‘ifrit, but you would not give up your intention to kill me. Similarly, the king insisted: ‘I shall not be safe unless I put you to death. You cured me with something that I held in my hand, and I cannot be sure that you will not kill me with something that I smell or in some other way.’ Duban said: ‘My reward from you, O king, is the reward of good by evil,’ but the king insisted: ‘You must be killed without delay.’\\n\\nWhen Duban was certain that the king was going to have him killed, he wept in sorrow for the good that he had done to the undeserving, as the poet has said:\\n\\nYou can be sure that Maimuna has no sense,\\n\\nThough this is what her father has.\\n\\nWhoever walks on dry or slippery ground,\\n\\nAnd takes no thought, must fall.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe executioner then came up, blindfolded him and unsheathed his sword, asking the king’s permission to proceed. Duban was weeping and imploring the king: ‘Spare me and God will spare you; do not slay me lest God slay you.’ He recited:\\n\\nI gave my good advice and yet had no success,\\n\\nWhile they succeeded, but through treachery.\\n\\nWhat I advised humiliated me.\\n\\nIf I live, never shall I give advice again;\\n\\nIf not, after my death let all advisors be accursed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he said to the king: ‘If this is how you reward me, it is the crocodile’s reward.’ The king asked for the story of the crocodile, but Duban replied: ‘I cannot tell it to you while I am in this state. I conjure you by God to spare me so that God may spare you.’ At that one of the king’s courtiers got up and asked the king for Duban’s life, pointing out: ‘We have not seen that he has done you any wrong, but only that he cured you of a disease that no wise doctor was able to treat.’ The king said: ‘You do not know why I have ordered his death, but this is because, if I spare him, I shall certainly die. A man who cured me of my illness by something that I held in my hand is able to kill me by something that I smell. I am afraid that he has been bribed to murder me, as he is a spy and this is why he has come here. He must be executed, and after that I shall be safe.’\\n\\nDuban repeated his plea for mercy, but on realizing that he could not escape execution, he said to the king: ‘If I must be killed, allow me a delay so that I may return to my house, give instructions to my family and my neighbours about my funeral, settle my debts and give away my books of medicine. I have a very special book which I shall present to you to be kept in your treasury.’ ‘What is in the book?’ asked the king. ‘Innumerable secrets,’ Duban replied, ‘the least of which is that, if you cut off my head and then open three pages and read three lines from the left-hand page, my head will speak to you and answer all your questions.’ The astonished king trembled with joy. ‘When I cut off your head, will you really talk to me?’ he asked. ‘Yes,’ said Duban. ‘This is an amazing thing!’ exclaimed the king, and he sent him off under escort.\\n\\nDuban returned to his house and settled all his affairs, and then the next day he came back to the court, where all the viziers, chamberlains, deputies and officers of state assembled, until the place looked like a garden in flower. He entered and was brought before the king, carrying with him an old book together with a collyrium case containing powder. He sat down and asked for a plate, which was brought. He then poured the powder on it and spread it out, after which he said: ‘King, take this book, but don’t open it until you cut off my head. When you have done that, set the head on the plate and have it pressed into the powder. At that, the flow of blood will halt and you can then open the book.’\\n\\nThe king took the book from him and gave orders for his execution. The executioner cut off his head, which fell on the plate, where it was pressed down into the powder. The blood ceased to flow and Duban the wise opened his eyes and said: ‘O king, open the book.’ The king did this, but he found the pages stuck together, so he put his finger into his mouth, wet it with his spittle, and with difficulty he opened the first, the second and the third pages. He opened six pages in all, but when he looked at them, he could find nothing written there. ‘Wise man,’ he said, ‘there is no writing here.’ ‘Open more pages,’ said Duban. The king opened three more, but soon afterwards he felt the poison with which the book had been impregnated spreading through him. He was wracked by convulsions and cried out that he had been poisoned, while Duban recited:\\n\\nThey wielded power with arrogance,\\n\\nBut soon it was as though their power had never been.\\n\\nIf they had acted justly, they would have met with justice,\\n\\nBut they were tyrants and Time played the tyrant in return,\\n\\nAfflicting them with grievous trials.\\n\\nIt was as though here fate was telling them:\\n\\n‘This is a return for that, and Time cannot be blamed.’\\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as Duban’s head had finished speaking, the king fell dead. Know then, ‘ifrit, that had he spared Duban, God would have spared him, but as he refused and looked to have him killed, God destroyed him. Had you spared me, God would have spared you…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.6306327], 'Then, when it was the twelfth night, SHE CONTINUED:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that the dervish said to the lady of the house, to Ja‘far and the caliph and the rest of the company that were listening: ‘My uncle struck his son with his shoe, as he lay there, burned black as charcoal.’ HE WENT ON:\\n\\nThis astonished me and I was filled with grief for my cousin and at the fate that had overtaken him and the girl. ‘By God, uncle,’ I said, ‘remove rancour from your heart. My heart and mind are filled with concern; I am saddened by what has happened to my cousin, and by the fact that he and this girl have been left like charcoal. Is their fate not enough for you that you strike your son with your shoe?’ He said: ‘Nephew, from his earliest days this son of mine was passionately in love with his sister. I used to keep him away from her and I would tell myself: “They are only children,” but when they grew up they committed a foul sin. I heard of this and, although I did not believe it, I seized him and reproached him bitterly, saying: “Beware of doing what no one has done before you or will do after you and which will remain as a source of disgrace and disparagement among the kings until the end of time, as the news is carried by the caravans. Take care not to act like this or else I shall be angry with you and kill you.”\\n\\n‘I kept him away from her and kept her from him, but the damned girl was deeply in love with him and Satan got the upper hand and made their actions seem good to them. When my son saw that I was keeping him from his sister, he constructed this underground chamber, set it in order and provisioned it, as you see. Then, taking me unawares when I had gone out hunting, he came here, but the Righteous God was jealous of them and consumed them both with fire, while their punishment in the next world will be harsher and stronger.’\\n\\nHe then wept and I wept with him, and he looked at me and said: ‘You are my son in his place.’ I thought for a time about this world and its happenings and of how my father had been killed by his vizier, who had then taken his place and who had plucked out my eye, and I thought of the strange fate of my cousin. I wept and my uncle wept with me. Then we climbed back up and replaced the cover and the earth and restored the tomb as it had been, after which we returned to the palace. Before we had sat down, however, we heard the noise of drums, kettledrums and trumpets, the clatter of lances, the shouting of men, the clink of bridles and the neighing of horses. The sky was darkened by sand and dust kicked up by horses’ hooves and we were bewildered, not knowing what had happened. When we asked, we were told that the vizier who had taken my father’s kingdom had fitted out his troops, collected men, hired Bedouin, and come with an army like the sands that could not be numbered and which no one could withstand. They had made a surprise attack on the city, which had proved unable to resist and which had surrendered to them.\\n\\nAfter this, my uncle was killed and I fled to the edge of the city, saying to myself: ‘If I fall into this man’s hands, he will kill me.’ Fresh sorrows were piled on me; I remembered what had happened to my father and to my uncle and I wondered what to do, for if I showed myself, the townspeople and my father’s men would recognize me and I would be killed. The only way of escape that I could find was to shave off my beard and my moustache, which I did, and after that I changed my clothes and went out of the city. I then came here, hoping that someone might take me to the Commander of the Faithful, the caliph of the Lord of creation, so that I might talk to him and tell him the story of what had happened to me. I got here tonight and was at a loss to know where to go when I came to where this dervish was standing. I greeted him and told him that I was a stranger, at which he said: ‘I too am a stranger.’ While we were talking, our third companion here came up to us, greeted us, introducing himself as a stranger, to which we made the same reply. We then walked on as darkness fell and fate led us to you. This is the story of why my beard and moustache have been shaved and of how I lost my eye.\\n\\nThe lady said: ‘Touch your forelock and go.’ ‘Not before I hear someone else’s tale,’ the man replied. The others wondered at his story and the caliph said to Ja‘far: ‘By God, I have never seen or heard the like of what has happened to this dervish.’ The second dervish then came forward and kissed the ground. HE SAID:\\n\\nLady, I was not born one-eyed and my story is a marvellous one which, were it written with needles on the inner corners of the eyes of men, would serve as a warning to those who take heed. I was a king, the son of a king. I studied the seven readings of the Quran; I read books and discussed them with men of learning; I studied astronomy, poetry and all other branches of knowledge until I surpassed all the people of my time, while my calligraphy was unrivalled. My fame spread through all lands and among all kings. So it was that the king of India heard of me and he sent a messenger to my father, together with gifts and presents suitable for royalty, to ask for me. My father equipped me with six ships and after a full month’s voyage we came to land.\\n\\nWe unloaded the horses that we had taken on board with us and we loaded ten camels with presents, but we had only travelled a short way when suddenly we saw a dust cloud which rose and spread until it filled the sky. After a while, it cleared away to show beneath it fifty mail-clad horsemen like scowling lions, and on closer inspection we could see that they were Bedouin highwaymen. When they saw our small numbers, and that we had ten camels laden with gifts for the king of India, they rushed at us with levelled lances. We gestured to them with our fingers and said: ‘We are envoys on our way to the great king of India, so do not harm us.’ ‘We don’t live in his country,’ they told us, ‘and are no subjects of his.’ Then they killed some of my servants, while the rest took flight. I was badly wounded and I too fled, but the Bedouin did not pursue me, being too busy sorting through the money and the gifts that we had brought with us.\\n\\nHaving been cast down from my position of power, I went off with no notion of where I was going, and I carried on until I reached the top of a mountain, where I took refuge in a cave until daybreak. I continued travelling like this until I came to a strong and secure city, from which cold winter had retreated, while spring had come with its roses. Flowers were blooming; there were gushing streams and the birds were singing. It fitted the description of the poet:\\n\\nA place whose citizens are subject to no fear,\\n\\nAnd safety is the master there.\\n\\nFor its people it is a decorated shield,\\n\\nIts wonders being plain to see.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I was tired out with walking and pale with care, I was glad to get there. With my changed circumstances, I had no idea where to go. Passing by a tailor in his shop, I greeted him and he returned my greeting and welcomed me with cheerful friendliness. When he asked me why I had left my own country, I told him what had happened to me from beginning to end. He was sorry for me and said: ‘Young man, don’t tell anyone about yourself, as I am afraid lest the king of this city might do you some harm as he is one of your father’s greatest enemies and has a blood feud with him.’ He then produced food and drink and he and I ate together. I chatted with him that night and he gave me a place to myself at the side of his shop and fetched me what I needed in the way of bedding and blankets.\\n\\nI stayed with him for three days, and he then asked: ‘Do you know any craft by which to make your living?’ I told him: ‘I am a lawyer, a scientist, a scribe, a mathematician and a calligrapher.’ ‘There is no market for that kind of thing here,’ he replied. ‘No one in this city has any knowledge of science or of writing and their only concern is making money.’ ‘By God,’ I said, ‘I know nothing apart from what I have told you.’ He said: ‘Tighten your belt, take an axe and a rope and bring in firewood from the countryside. This will give you a livelihood until God brings you relief, but don’t let people know who you are or else you will be killed.’ He then brought me an axe and a rope and handed me over to some woodcutters, telling them to look after me. I went out with them and collected wood for a whole day, after which I carried back a load on my head and sold it for half a dinar. With part of this I bought food and the rest I saved.\\n\\nI went on like this for a year, and then when the year was up, I came out to the countryside one day, as usual, and as I was wandering there alone I found a tree-filled hollow where there was wood aplenty. Going down into the hollow, I came across a thick tree stump and dug round it, removing the soil. My axe then happened to strike against a copper ring and, on clearing away the earth, I discovered a wooden trapdoor, which I opened. Below it appeared a flight of steps, and when I reached the bottom of these, I saw a door, on entering which I saw a most beautiful palace set with pillars. In it I found a girl like a splendid pearl, one to banish from the heart all trace of care, sorrow and distress, while her words would dispel worries and would leave a man, however intelligent and sensible, robbed of his senses. She was of medium height, with rounded breasts and soft cheeks; she was radiant and beautifully formed, with a face shining in the black night of her hair, while the gleam of her mouth was reflected on her breast. She was as the poet said:\\n\\nDark-haired and slim-waisted,\\n\\nHer buttocks were like sand dunes\\n\\nAnd her figure like that of a ban tree.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is another verse:\\n\\nThere are four things never before united\\n\\nExcept to pierce my heart and shed my blood:\\n\\nA radiant forehead, hair like night,\\n\\nA rosy cheek, and a slim form.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I looked at her, I praised the Creator for the beauty and loveliness that He had produced in her. She looked at me in turn and asked: ‘What are you, a human or one of the jinn?’ ‘A human,’ I told her, and she asked: ‘Who brought you to this place where I have been for twenty-five years without ever seeing a fellow human?’ I found her speech so sweet that it filled my heart, and I said, ‘It was my lucky stars that brought me here, my lady, to drive away my cares and sorrows.’ Then I told her from beginning to end what had happened to me and she found my plight hard to bear and wept. ‘I, for my part,’ she said, ‘will now tell you my own story. You must know that I am the daughter of King Iftamus, lord of the Ebony Islands. He had given me in marriage to my cousin, but on my wedding night I was snatched away by an ‘ifrit named Jirjis, son of Rajmus, the son of the maternal aunt of Iblis. He flew off with me and brought me down into this place, where he fetched everything that was needed – clothes, ornaments, fabrics, furniture, food, drink and everything else. He comes once every ten days, sleeps here for the night and then goes on his way, as he took me without the permission of his own people. He has promised me that if I need anything night or day, and if I touch with my hand these two lines inscribed on the inside of this dome, before I take my hand away he shall appear before me. Today is the fourth day since he was here, and so there are six left until he comes again. Would you like to stay with me for five days and you can then leave one day before he returns?’ ‘Yes,’ I replied. ‘How splendid it is when dreams come true!’\\n\\nThis made her glad and, rising to her feet, she took me by the hand and led me through an arched door to a fine, elegant bath. When I saw this, I took off my clothes and she took off hers. After bathing, she stepped out and sat on a bench with me by her side. Then she poured me out wine flavoured with musk and brought food. We ate and talked, until she said: ‘Sleep, rest, for you are tired.’ Forgetting all my troubles, I thanked her and fell asleep. When I woke, I found her massaging my feet. ‘God bless you,’ I said and we sat there talking for a time. ‘By God,’ she said, ‘I was unhappy, living by myself under the ground, with no one to talk to me for twenty-five years. Praise be to God, Who has sent you to me.’ Then she asked me whether I would like some wine, and when I said yes, she went to a cupboard and produced old wine in a sealed flask. She then set out some green branches, took the wine and recited:\\n\\nHad I known you were coming, I would have spread\\n\\nMy heart’s blood or the pupils of my eyes.\\n\\nMy cheeks would have been a carpet when we met\\n\\nSo that you could have walked over my eyelids.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she had finished these lines, I thanked her; love of her had taken possession of my heart and my cares and sorrows were gone. We sat drinking together until nightfall, and I then passed with her a night the like of which I had never known in my life. When morning came we were still joining delights to delights, and this went on until midday. I was so drunk that I had lost my senses and I got up, swaying right and left, and I said: ‘Get up, my beauty, and I will bring you out from under the earth and free you from this ‘ifrit.’ She laughed and said: ‘Be content with what you have and stay silent. Out of every ten days he will have one and nine will be for you.’ But drunkenness had got the better of me and I said: ‘I shall now smash the dome with the inscription; let him come, so that I may kill him, for I am accustomed to killing ‘ifrits.’ On hearing this, she turned pale and exclaimed: ‘By God, don’t do it!’ Then she recited:\\n\\nIf there is something that will destroy you,\\n\\nProtect yourself from it.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe added more lines:\\n\\nYou look for separation, but rein in\\n\\nThe horse that seeks to head the field.\\n\\nPatience, for Time’s nature is treacherous,\\n\\nAnd at the end companions part.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe finished her poem but, paying no attention to her words of warning, I aimed a violent kick at the dome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.61470866], 'Then, when it was the seventeenth night, SHE CONTINUED:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that when the lady of the house stood before the caliph, SHE SAID:\\n\\nMine is a strange story. The two black bitches are my sisters. Three of us were full sisters and these two, the doorkeeper and the housekeeper, were born of a different mother. When our father died, each of us took her share of the inheritance. Some days later, my mother died, leaving us three thousand dinars, and so each of us, I being the youngest, inherited a thousand dinars. My sisters were thus equipped with dowries and each married. Their husbands stayed for a time, but then they collected trade goods and, each of them taking a thousand dinars from his wife, they all went off on a voyage together, leaving me behind. They were away for five years, during which time the men lost their money and were ruined, abandoning their wives in foreign parts.\\n\\nAfter five years, my eldest sister came to me in the most squalid of states, dressed as a beggar, with tattered clothes and a dirty old shawl. When I saw her, I didn’t recognize her at first and took no notice of her. Then, realizing who she was, I asked her what had happened, but she said: ‘It is no use talking, sister, the pen of fate has written God’s decree.’ So I sent her to the baths, gave her clothes to wear and said: ‘Sister, you have been given to me in exchange for my father and mother. My share of what the three of us inherited has been blest by God and it has allowed me to thrive and become prosperous. You and I are equal partners.’ I treated her with all kindness and she stayed with me for a whole year.\\n\\nWe were concerned about our other sister, but it was not long before she too arrived in an even worse plight than the eldest. I treated her even better than I had treated her sister and both of them shared in my wealth. Some time later, they told me that they wanted to marry again as they could not bear to remain without husbands. ‘My dears,’ I said, ‘there is no longer any benefit to be got from marriage and good men are hard to find now. I don’t see any advantage in your proposal and you have already had experience of marriage.’ My sisters did not accept that and married without my approval although I covered all their costs. They then left with their husbands, who very soon afterwards played them false, took all that they had and went off, abandoning them.\\n\\nOnce again they came back to me, covered in shame, apologized and said: ‘Don’t blame us. You may be younger than us but you are more intelligent; we shall never again mention marriage, so take us as your slave girls that we may have a bite to eat.’ ‘Welcome, sisters,’ I said. ‘No one is dearer to me than you.’ And I kissed them and honoured them even more than before. This went on for a full year, after which I decided to fit out a ship to go to Basra. I chose a large one and loaded it with goods, merchandise and everything needed for the voyage. I asked my sisters whether they would prefer to sit at home until I returned from my voyage or whether they would like to come with me. ‘We will go with you,’ they said, ‘as we cannot bear to be parted from you,’ and so I took them along.\\n\\nI had divided my wealth in two, taking half with me and leaving the other half behind, with the idea that, were the ship to be wrecked and we survived, there would be something to support us on our return. We sailed for some days and nights, but the ship then went astray as the captain had not kept to the right course, and without realizing it, we were sailing in the wrong direction. This went on for some time and over a period of ten days we had fair winds. After that, the lookout climbed up to investigate; he called out: ‘Good news!’ and came down full of joy and told us that he had seen what looked like a city resembling a dove. We were delighted and, within an hour, we could see the place in the distance. We asked the captain its name, but he said: ‘By God, I don’t know. I have never seen it before and never in my life have I sailed on this sea. But things have turned out safely and all we have to do is put in to harbour. Look out your merchandise and if you can sell, sell and then buy up whatever is there; if that does not work, we can rest here for two days, buy provisions and go on with our voyage.’\\n\\nWe put in and the captain went up to the city. He was away for a time and when he came back he told us: ‘Come up and wonder at what God has done to those He created, and seek refuge from His anger.’ We went to the city and when we came to the gate, we saw that it was guarded by men with sticks in their hands, but when we got nearer we found that they had been turned to stone, while in the city itself we found that everyone had been transformed to black stone and there was no trace of life. We were astonished, but as we threaded our way through the markets, we discovered that the traders’ wares and the gold and silver had remained unchanged. This delighted us and, thinking that there must be some mystery here, we split up and walked through the city streets, each concerned to collect her own booty, money and fabrics.\\n\\nI myself went to the castle, which turned out to be strongly fortified, and I then entered the royal apartments, where all the utensils were made of gold and silver. There I saw the king wearing robes of bewildering splendour, seated with his chamberlains, officers and viziers. When I approached, I found that he was sitting on a throne studded with pearls and gems, wearing cloth of gold, with every jewel gleaming like a star. Standing around him were fifty mamluks, dressed in silks of various kinds, with drawn swords in their stone hands – an astonishing sight. I then walked into the hall of the harem, whose walls were covered with hangings of silk with gold-embroidered branches. The queen was there asleep, wearing a robe ornamented with fresh pearls. On her head was a crown studded with gemstones of all kinds, while around her neck were necklaces of all sorts. Everything she was wearing, dress and ornaments, was unchanged, but she herself had been transformed to black stone.\\n\\nI then found an open door and went up to it. There were seven steps and these led to a chamber whose marble floor was spread with gold-embroidered carpets. In it there was a couch made of juniper wood, inset with pearls and precious stones, together with two large emeralds, covered by a pearl-studded hanging. There was also a door from which I could see a light shining. I went to stand over it and there in the centre on a small chair I found a jewel the size of a duck’s egg, burning like a candle and shedding light, while spread over the couch was an amazing array of silks. The sight filled me with astonishment. On looking further, I saw lighted candles. ‘Someone must have lit these,’ I said to myself, and I then went to another room and proceeded to search all through the building, forgetting myself in my astonishment at all this and plunged in thought.\\n\\nI continued exploring until nightfall, but then, wishing to leave, I found I had lost my way and had no idea where the gate was. So I went back to the chamber with the lighted candles, sat down on the couch and, after reciting a portion of the Quran, wrapped myself in a coverlet, trying in vain to sleep but becoming uneasy. Then at midnight I heard a beautiful voice reciting the Quran. This filled me with joy and I followed the sound until I came to a small room whose door was shut. I opened it and looked inside, to find a chapel with a prayer niche in which hung lighted lamps together with two candles. In this chapel a prayer rug had been put down and on this sat a handsome young man with, before him, a copy of the holy Quran from which he was reading.\\n\\nWondering how he alone had been saved from out of all the inhabitants of the city, I entered and greeted him. He looked up and returned my greeting, at which I said: ‘By the truth of what you have recited from the Book of God, I implore you to answer my question.’ He looked at me, smiling, and replied: ‘Servant of God, do you tell me why you came here and I will tell you what happened to me and the people of this city and how it was that I escaped.’ So I told him my story, which filled him with wonder, and then I asked him about the townspeople. ‘Wait, sister,’ he said, and he then closed the Quran and put it into a bag of satin, before making me sit beside him. When I looked at him, I saw him to be the moon when it comes to the full, excellent in his attributes, supple and handsome; his appearance was like a sugar stick, with a well-proportioned frame. As the poet has said:\\n\\nTo the astrologer watching by night\\n\\nAppeared a beautiful form dressed in twin robes.\\n\\nSaturn had granted him black hair,\\n\\nColouring his temples with the shade of musk.\\n\\nFrom Mars derived the redness of his cheek,\\n\\nWhile Sagittarius shot arrows from his eyelids.\\n\\nMercury supplied keenness of mind\\n\\nWhile the Bear forbade the slanderers to look at him.\\n\\nThe astrologer was bewildered by what he saw\\n\\nAnd the ground before him was kissed by the full moon.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmighty God had clothed him in the robe of perfection and embroidered it with the beauty and splendour of the down of his cheek, as the poet has said:\\n\\nI swear by the intoxication of his eyelids,\\n\\nBy his waist and by the arrows that his magic shoots,\\n\\nBy the smoothness of his flanks, the sharpness of his glance,\\n\\nHis white complexion and the darkness of his hair,\\n\\nHis eyebrow that denies sleep to my eye,\\n\\nControlling me as he orders and forbids,\\n\\nBy his rosy cheek and the myrtle of its down,\\n\\nBy the carnelian of his mouth, his pearly teeth,\\n\\nBy his neck and by the beauty of his form,\\n\\nWith pomegranates showing on his chest,\\n\\nBy his haunches that quiver whether he moves or is still,\\n\\nBy his slender waist and by his silken touch,\\n\\nThe lightness of his spirit and all the beauty he encompasses.\\n\\nI swear by his generous hand and by his truthful tongue,\\n\\nHis high birth and his lofty rank.\\n\\nFor those who know of musk, it is his scent,\\n\\nAnd he it is who spreads the scent of ambergris.\\n\\nCompared with him the radiant sun\\n\\nIs nothing but the paring of a fingernail.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe glance that I gave him was followed by a thousand sighs and love for him was fixed in my heart. ‘My master,’ I said, ‘answer my question.’ ‘Willingly,’ he replied, and he went on: ‘Know, servant of God, that this is my father’s city and he is the king whom you saw sitting on the throne turned into black stone, while the queen whom you saw in the hall is my mother. All the people of the city were Magians, worshipping fire rather than Almighty God. They would swear by fire, light, shadows, the heat of the sun and the circling sphere. After my father had for long been without a son, late in his life I was born to him. He brought me up until I was a grown man, and good fortune always preceded me. With us there was an old Muslim woman who believed in God and His Apostle in secret, while in public she followed the practices of my people. My father had faith in her because he saw that she was trustworthy and chaste, and he showed her great respect, thinking that she was his co-religionary. When I grew older he entrusted me to her, saying: “Take him; give him a good upbringing; ground him in the tenets of our faith and look after him.” When she had taken me, she taught me about the religion of Islam with the obligations of ritual purification and of prayer, and she made me learn the Quran by heart, telling me to worship none but Almighty God. When she had done all this, she told me to keep it hidden from my father and not to tell him lest he kill me. So I kept the secret for a few days, but then the old woman died and the people of the city sank ever further into unbelief and presumptuous error.\\n\\n‘While they were in this state, suddenly they heard a mighty voice like the rumbling of thunder, calling out in tones that could be heard far and near: “Citizens, turn away from the worship of fire and worship God, the Merciful King.” The people were startled and they all came to my father, the king, and asked: “What is this alarming voice that we have heard, astounding and terrifying us?” “Do not be alarmed or frightened by it,” he replied, “and do not let it turn you from your religion.” Their hearts inclined to what he said; they persisted in their worship of fire and they acted even more wickedly until a year had passed from the first time that they had heard the voice. They then heard it for a second time and, after three years, for a third time – once each year – but they still clung to their beliefs. Then, at dawn one day, divine wrath descended and they, together with their animals and their flocks, were turned to black stone. I was the only one to escape and since that happened, I have been living like this – praying, fasting and reciting the Quran – but I can no longer endure being alone, with no one to keep me company.’\\n\\nI had lost my heart to him, so I asked him whether he would go to Baghdad with me where he could meet the men of learning and the faqihs, and so add to his knowledge, understanding and grasp of religious law. ‘Know,’ I went on, ‘that the slave who stands before you is the mistress of her people, with command over men, eunuchs and slaves. I have a ship laden with merchandise and it was fate that led us here in order that we should see these things, and it was ordained by destiny that you and I should meet.’\\n\\nI continued to prompt him to leave with me, flattering him and using my wiles until he agreed to accept.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.6084552], 'Then, when it was the twentieth night, SHE CONTINUED:\\n\\nI have heard, O auspicious king, that the caliph swore that he would hang no one but the slave, as what the young man had done was excusable. Then he turned to Ja‘far and said: ‘Fetch me this damned slave who was responsible for all this, and if you fail, you will take his place.’ Ja‘far went away weeping and saying: ‘Twice I have been threatened with death; the pitcher does not always escape unbroken. There is nothing that I can do about this but hope that He who saved me on the first occasion may save me on the second. By God, I shall not leave my house for three days, and the True God will do what He sees fit.’\\n\\nAccordingly, he stayed inside for three days and on the fourth he brought in the qadis and the notaries and took a tearful farewell of his children. At that moment, a messenger arrived from the caliph, saying: ‘The Commander of the Faithful is furiously angry and has sent for you, saying that before the day is over you will be hanged.’ When Ja‘far heard that, he wept, as did his children, his slaves and his whole household. When he had finished taking leave of the others, he went up to his youngest daughter, whom he loved more than all his other children, to say goodbye to her. He clasped her to his breast, kissed and wept at parting from her. In her pocket he could feel something round and he asked her what it was. ‘An apple, father,’ she told him, ‘inscribed with the name of our lord, the caliph. Our slave Raihan brought it four days ago and would not give it to me until I paid him two dinars.’\\n\\nWhen Ja‘far heard about the slave and the apple, he was overjoyed. Putting his hand into his daughter’s pocket, he brought out the apple and recognized it, exclaiming: ‘O God, Whose deliverance is near at hand!’ He then ordered the slave to be brought, and when he had come, Ja‘far asked him where he had got the apple. ‘By God, master,’ he replied, ‘if lies can save a man once, truth can save him twice. I didn’t steal it from your palace, from the imperial palace or from the Commander of the Faithful’s orchard. Five days ago, while I was out walking, I went into a lane in the city where I saw some children playing. One of them had this apple and I snatched it away from him and hit him. He cried and told me that it belonged to his sick mother. “She wanted my father to get her an apple,” he told me, “and my father went to Basra and bought her three of them, for which he paid three dinars. I stole one of the three to play with.” I paid no attention to the child’s tears and took the apple and came here. Then my little mistress paid two gold dinars for it. That is my story.’\\n\\nWhen Ja‘far heard this, he was amazed that the mischief involving the death of the girl had been caused by his own slave. He was sorry for his connection with him but delighted at his own escape, reciting these lines:\\n\\nWhen a slave brings disaster on you,\\n\\nUse him as a ransom for your life.\\n\\nYou can get many other slaves,\\n\\nBut you will never find another life.\\n\\n\\n\\nGrasping the slave by the hand, he brought him to the caliph and told him his story from beginning to end. The caliph was full of astonishment and laughed until he fell over. He ordered that the story should be written down and spread among the people, but Ja‘far said: ‘Do not wonder at this tale for it is not more astonishing than the story of the vizier Nur al-Din ‘Ali, the Egyptian, and Shams al-Din Muhammad, his brother.’ ‘Tell it to me,’ said the caliph, ‘although what can be more wonderful than the story we have just heard?’ ‘I shall not tell it to you,’ said Ja‘far, ‘unless you promise not to execute my slave.’ ‘If it is really more remarkable than what has just happened, I shall grant you his life, but if not, then I shall have him killed.’ JA‘FAR BEGAN:\\n\\nKnow then, Commander of the Faithful, that in the old days there was in Egypt a just and upright sultan who loved the poor and would sit with men of learning. He had an intelligent and experienced vizier, with a knowledge of affairs and of administration. This vizier was a very old man and he had two sons, fair as moons, unequalled in comeliness and beauty. The name of the elder was Shams al-Din Muhammad, while the younger was Nur al-Din ‘Ali. Nur al-Din was more conspicuously graceful and handsome than his brother, so much so that his fame had spread in other lands, and people came to Egypt to see his beauty.\\n\\nIt then happened that their father died. He was mourned by the sultan, who went to the sons, brought them close to him and gave them robes of honour. ‘Do not be distressed,’ he said, ‘for you will take your father’s place.’ This delighted them and they kissed the ground in front of him. After a month of mourning for their father, they entered into office as joint viziers, sharing between themselves the power that had been in their father’s hands, with one of them accompanying the sultan whenever he went on his travels.\\n\\nIt happened that the sultan was about to leave on a journey in the morning and it was the turn of the elder brother to go with him. On the night before, the two brothers were talking together and the elder said to the younger: ‘Brother, it is my intention that you and I should marry on the same night.’ ‘Do what you want,’ said his brother, ‘for I agree to your suggestion.’ When they had made this agreement, the elder said: ‘If God so decrees, we shall marry two girls and consummate the marriage on one and the same night. Then they will give birth on the same day and, God willing, your wife will produce a boy and mine a girl. We shall then marry them to each other and they will be husband and wife.’ ‘What dowry will you ask from my son for your daughter?’ asked Nur al-Din. ‘I shall take from your son,’ replied Shams al-Din, ‘three thousand dinars, three orchards and three estates. On no other terms will the marriage contract be valid.’\\n\\nWhen he heard this, Nur al-Din said: ‘What is this dowry that you want to impose as a condition on my son? Don’t you know that we two are brothers and that both of us, by God’s grace, are joint viziers, equal in rank? You should give your daughter to my son without asking for any dowry at all, and if there must be one, then it should be fixed at something that will merely show people that a payment has been made. You know that the male is better than the female. My son is a male and it is through him and not through your daughter that we shall be remembered.’ ‘What about my daughter, then?’ asked Shams al-Din. ‘It will not be through her that we shall be remembered among the emirs,’ his brother told him, and added: ‘You want to deal with me like the man in the story who approached one of his friends to ask for something. “I swear by the Name of God,” said his friend, “that I shall do what you ask, but tomorrow.” In reply, the other recited:\\n\\nIf favours are put off until next day,\\n\\nFor those who know, that is rejection.’\\n\\n\\n\\nShams al-Din said: ‘I see that you are selling me short and making out that your son is better than my daughter. It is clear that you lack intelligence and have no manners. You talk about our shared vizierate, but I only let you share out of pity for you, so that you might help me as an assistant and I might not cause you disappointment. Now, by God, after what you have said, I shall not marry my daughter to your son, even if you were to pay out her weight in gold.’ Nur al-Din was angry when he heard this and said: ‘I’m no longer willing to marry my son to your daughter.’ ‘And I’m not prepared to accept him as a husband for her,’ repeated Shams al-Din, adding: ‘Were I not going off on a journey I would make an example of you, but when I get back, I shall let you see what my honour requires.’\\n\\nOn hearing what his brother had to say, Nur al-Din was beside himself with anger, but he managed to conceal this. The two of them spent the night in separate quarters and in the morning the sultan set out on his journey, going by Giza and making for the Pyramids, accompanied by the vizier Shams al-Din. As for Shams al-Din’s brother, Nur al-Din, after spending the night in a furious rage, he got up and performed the morning prayer. Then he went to his strongroom and, taking out a small pair of saddlebags, he filled them with gold. Remembering his brother’s contemptuous remarks, he started to recite these lines:\\n\\nGo, and you will replace the one you leave behind;\\n\\nWork hard, for in this lies life’s pleasure.\\n\\nThe stay-at-home is humble, arriving at no goal\\n\\nExcept distress, so leave your land and go.\\n\\nI see that water left to stand goes bad;\\n\\nIf it flows, it is sweet, but if not, it is not.\\n\\nWere the full moon not to wane,\\n\\nThe watcher would not always follow it.\\n\\nLions that do not leave their lair will find no prey;\\n\\nArrows not shot from bows can strike no target.\\n\\nGold dust when in the mine is worth no more than earth,\\n\\nAnd aloes wood in its own land is merely used for fires.\\n\\nWhen taken from the mine, gold is a precious object of demand,\\n\\nWhile elsewhere in the world it is outranked by aloes wood.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Nur al-Din had finished these lines, he told one of his servants to prepare the official mule with its quilted saddle. This beast, coloured like a starling, had a high, dome-like back; its saddle was of gold and its stirrups of Indian steel; its trappings were like those of the Chosroes; and it looked like a bride unveiled. Nur al-Din ordered that a silk carpet and a prayer rug should be put on it, with the saddlebags being placed under the rug. He then told his servants and slaves that he was going on a pleasure trip outside the city. ‘I shall go towards Qalyub,’ he said, ‘and spend three nights away. None of you are to follow me, for I am feeling depressed.’\\n\\nHe quickly mounted the mule, taking with him only a few provisions, and he then left Cairo, making for open country. By noon he had reached Bilbais, where he dismounted, rested and allowed the mule to rest too. He took and ate some of his provisions, and in Bilbais he bought more food for himself and fodder for his mule. He then set out into the country, and when night fell, he had come to a place called al-Sa‘diya. Here he spent the night, getting out some food, placing the saddlebags beneath his head and spreading out the carpet. He slept there in the desert, still consumed with anger, and after his night’s sleep, he rode off in the morning, urging on his mule until he came to Aleppo. There he stayed for three days in one of the khans, looking around the place at his leisure until both he and the mule were rested. Then he decided to move on and, mounting his mule, he rode out of the city without knowing where he was heading. His journey continued until, without knowing where he was, he reached Basra. He stopped at a khan, unloaded the saddlebags from the mule and spread out the prayer mat. He then handed over the mule with all its gear to the gatekeeper of the khan, asking him to exercise it, which he did.\\n\\nIt happened that the vizier of Basra was sitting at the window of his palace. He looked at the mule with its costly trappings and thought that it might be a ceremonial beast, the mount of viziers or kings. Perplexed by this, he told one of his servants to bring him the gatekeeper of the city. The servant did as he was told, and the gatekeeper came to him and kissed the ground. The vizier, who was a very old man, asked him who the mule’s owner might be and what he was like. ‘Master,’ said the gatekeeper, ‘the owner of this mule is a very young man of the merchant class, impressive and dignified, with elegant manners, the son of a merchant.’ On hearing this, the vizier got up and after riding to the khan, he approached Nur al-Din who, seeing him coming, rose to meet him. He greeted the vizier who, in turn, welcomed him, dismounted from his horse, and embraced him, making him sit beside him. ‘My son,’ he said, ‘where have you come from and what do you want?’ ‘Master,’ replied Nur al-Din, ‘I have come from Cairo. I was the son of a vizier there, but my father moved from this world to the mercy of Almighty God.’ He then told his story from beginning to end, adding: ‘I have made up my mind that I shall never return until I have passed through every city and every land.’ ‘My son,’ said the vizier when he heard this, ‘do not obey the promptings of pride or you will destroy yourself. The lands are desolate and I am afraid lest Time bring misfortunes on you.’\\n\\nHe then had Nur al-Din’s saddlebags placed on the mule and, taking the carpet and the prayer mat, he brought him to his house where he lodged him in elegant quarters and showed him honour, kindness and much affection. ‘My boy,’ he said to him, ‘I am an old man and I have no son, but God has provided me with a daughter who is your match in beauty and whose hand I have refused to many suitors. I have conceived love for you in my heart and so I ask whether you would be willing to take her to serve you, while you become her husband. If you accept, I shall bring you to the sultan of Basra and tell him that you are the son of my brother, and I shall get him to appoint you as his vizier in my place. I shall then stay at home, for I am an old man.’\\n\\nWhen Nur al-Din heard what he had to say, he bowed his head and said: ‘To hear is to obey.’ The vizier was delighted and he told his servants to set out food and to decorate the main reception hall where the weddings of the emirs were held. He collected his friends and invited the great officials of state together with the merchants of Basra. When they came, he told them: ‘I had a brother, the vizier of Egypt. God provided him with two sons, while, as you know, He gave me a daughter. My brother had enjoined me to marry her to one of his sons. I agreed to this, and when the appropriate time for marriage came, he sent me one of his sons – this young man who is here with us. Now that he has arrived, I want to draw up the marriage contract between him and my daughter that the marriage may be consummated here, for he has a greater right to her hand than a stranger. After that, if he wants he can stay here, or if he prefers to leave, I shall send him and his wife off to his father.’\\n\\nEveryone there approved of the plan and, looking at Nur al-Din, they admired what they saw. The vizier then brought in the qadis and the notaries, who drew up the contract. Incense was scattered, sugared drinks served and rosewater sprinkled, after which the guests left. The vizier then told his servants to take Nur al-Din to the baths. He gave him a special robe of his own and sent him towels, bowls and censers, together with everything else that he might need. When he left the baths wearing the robes, he was like the moon when it is full on the fourteenth night. He mounted his mule and rode on until he reached the vizier’s palace, where he dismounted. Entering the vizier’s presence, he kissed his hand and was welcomed…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNights 21 to 40\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.6074757], 'When it was the third night, Dunyazad asked her sister to finish the story. ‘With pleasure,’ said Shahrazad and went on: ‘I have heard, O fortunate king, that the third old man told the ‘ifrit a more remarkable story than the other two, and that in his astonishment and delight the ‘ifrit granted him the remaining share of the blood debt and allowed the merchant to go free. For his part, the merchant went and thanked the old men, who congratulated him on his safety, after which each of them went home. This, however, is not more surprising than the tale of the fisherman.’ When the king asked what that was, she went on:\\n\\nI have heard, O fortunate king, that there once was a poor, elderly fisherman with a wife and three children, who was in the habit of casting his net exactly four times each day. He went out to the shore at noon one day, put down his basket, tucked up his shirt, waded into the sea and cast his net. He waited until it had sunk down before pulling its cords together and then, finding it heavy, he tried unsuccessfully to drag it in. He took one end of it to the shore and fixed it to a peg that he drove in there, after which he stripped and dived into the sea beside it, where he continued tugging until he managed to get it up. He climbed out delightedly, put his clothes back on and went up to the net, only to find that what was in it was a dead donkey, and that the donkey had made a hole in the net. The fisherman was saddened by this and recited the formula: ‘There is no might and no power except with God, the Exalted, the Omnipotent,’ before saying: ‘This is a strange thing that God has given me by way of food!’ and then reciting:\\n\\nYou who court danger, diving in the dark of night,\\n\\nGive up; your efforts do not win your daily bread from God.\\n\\nThe fisherman rises to earn his keep;\\n\\nThere is the sea, with stars woven in the sky.\\n\\nHe plunges in, buffeted by waves,\\n\\nHis eyes fixed on his billowing net.\\n\\nHappy with his night’s work, he takes back home\\n\\nA fish, its jaw caught up on his pronged hook.\\n\\nThis fish is bought from him by one who spent his night\\n\\nOut of the cold, enjoying his comforts.\\n\\nPraise be to God, Who gives and Who deprives;\\n\\nFor one man eats the fish; another catches it.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe encouraged himself, saying that Almighty God would show favour and reciting:\\n\\nWhen you are faced with hardship, clothe yourself\\n\\nIn noble patience; that is more resolute.\\n\\nDo not complain, then, to God’s servants; you complain\\n\\nTo those who have no mercy of the Merciful.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe freed the donkey from the net, which he then wrung out before spreading it out again and going back into the sea. Invoking the Name of God, he made another cast, waited until the net had settled, and found it heavier and more difficult to move than before. Thinking that it must be full of fish, he fastened it to his peg, stripped off his clothes and dived in to free it. After tugging at it he got it up on shore, only to discover that what was in it was a large jar full of sand and mud. Saddened by this sight, he recited:\\n\\nTroubles of Time, give up!\\n\\nStop, even if you have not had enough.\\n\\nI came out looking for my daily bread,\\n\\nBut I have found there is no more of this.\\n\\nHow many a fool reaches the Pleiades!\\n\\nHow many wise men lie hidden in the earth!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman threw away the jar, wrung out his net, cleaned it and went back a third time to the sea, asking God to forgive him. He made his cast and waited for the net to settle before drawing it in, and this time what he found in it were bits of pots, bottles and bones. He was furious and, shedding bitter tears, he recited:\\n\\nYou have no power at all over your daily bread;\\n\\nNeither learning nor letters will fetch it for you.\\n\\nFortune and sustenance are divided up;\\n\\nOne land is fertile while another suffers drought.\\n\\nTime’s changes bring down cultured men,\\n\\nWhile fortune lifts the undeserving up.\\n\\nCome, death, and visit me, for life is vile;\\n\\nFalcons are brought down low while ducks are raised on high.\\n\\nFeel no surprise if you should see a man of excellence\\n\\nIn poverty, while an inferior holds sway.\\n\\nOne bird circles the earth from east to west;\\n\\nAnother gets its food but does not have to move.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then looked up to heaven and said: ‘O my God, You know that I only cast my net four times a day. I have done this thrice and got nothing, so this time grant me something on which to live.’ He pronounced the Name of God and cast his net into the sea. He waited until it had settled and then he tried to pull it in, but found that it had snagged on the bottom. He recited the formula: ‘There is no power and no might except with God,’ and went on:\\n\\nHow wretched is this kind of world\\n\\nThat leaves us in such trouble and distress!\\n\\nIn the morning it may be that things go well,\\n\\nBut I must drink destruction’s cup when evening comes.\\n\\nYet when it is asked who leads the easiest life,\\n\\nMen would reply that this was I.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fisherman stripped off his clothes and, after diving in, he worked his hardest to drag the net to shore. Then, when he opened it up, he found in it a brass bottle with a lead seal, imprinted with the inscription of our master Solomon, the son of David, on both of whom be peace. The fisherman was delighted to see this, telling himself that it would fetch ten gold dinars if he sold it in the brass market. He shook it and, discovering that it was heavy as well as sealed, he said to himself: ‘I wonder what is in it? I’ll open it up and have a look before selling it.’ He took out a knife and worked on the lead until he had removed it from the bottle, which he then put down on the ground, shaking it in order to pour out its contents. To his astonishment, at first nothing came out, but then there emerged smoke which towered up into the sky and spread over the surface of the ground. When it had all come out, it collected and solidified; a tremor ran through it and it became an ‘ifrit with his head in the clouds and his feet on the earth. His head was like a dome, his hands were like winnowing forks and his feet like ships’ masts. He had a mouth like a cave with teeth like rocks, while his nostrils were like jugs and his eyes like lamps. He was dark and scowling.\\n\\nWhen he saw this ‘ifrit the fisherman shuddered; his teeth chattered; his mouth dried up and he could not see where he was going. At the sight of him the ‘ifrit exclaimed: ‘There is no god but the God of Solomon, His prophet. Prophet of God, do not kill me for I shall never disobey you again in word or in deed.’ ‘‘Ifrit,’ the fisherman said, ‘you talk of Solomon, the prophet of God, but Solomon died eighteen hundred years ago and we are living in the last age of the world. What is your story and how did you come to be in this bottle?’ To which the ‘ifrit replied: ‘There is no god but God. I have good news for you, fisherman.’ ‘What is that?’ the fisherman asked, and the ‘ifrit said: ‘I am now going to put you to the worst of deaths.’ ‘For this good news, leader of the ‘ifrits,’ exclaimed the fisherman, ‘you deserve that God’s protection be removed from you, you damned creature. Why should you kill me and what have I done to deserve this? It was I who saved you from the bottom of the sea and brought you ashore.’\\n\\nBut the ‘ifrit said: ‘Choose what death you want and how you want me to kill you.’ ‘What have I done wrong,’ asked the fisherman, ‘and why are you punishing me?’ The ‘ifrit replied: ‘Listen to my story,’ and the fisherman said: ‘Tell it, but keep it short as I am at my last gasp.’ ‘Know, fisherman,’ the ‘ifrit told him, ‘that I was one of the apostate jinn, and that together with Sakhr, the jinni, I rebelled against Solomon, the son of David, on both of whom be peace. Solomon sent his vizier, Asaf, to fetch me to him under duress, and I was forced to go with him in a state of humiliation to stand before Solomon. “I take refuge with God!” exclaimed Solomon when he saw me, and he then offered me conversion to the Faith and proposed that I enter his service. When I refused, he called for this bottle, in which he imprisoned me, sealing it with lead and imprinting on it the Greatest Name of God. Then, at his command, the jinn carried me off and threw me into the middle of the sea.\\n\\n‘For a hundred years I stayed there, promising myself that I would give whoever freed me enough wealth to last him for ever, but the years passed and no one rescued me. For the next hundred years I told myself that I would open up all the treasures of the earth for my rescuer, but still no one rescued me. Four hundred years later, I promised that I would grant three wishes, but when I still remained imprisoned, I became furiously angry and said to myself that I would kill whoever saved me, giving him a choice of how he wanted to die. It is you who are my rescuer, and so I allow you this choice.’\\n\\nWhen the fisherman heard this, he exclaimed in wonder at his bad luck in freeing the ‘ifrit now, and he went on: ‘Spare me, may God spare you, and do not kill me lest God place you in the power of one who will kill you.’ ‘I must kill you,’ insisted the ‘ifrit, ‘and so choose how you want to die.’ Ignoring this, the fisherman made another appeal, calling on the ‘ifrit to show gratitude for his release. ‘It is only because you freed me that I am going to kill you,’ repeated the ‘ifrit, at which the fisherman said: ‘Lord of the ‘ifrits, I have done you good and you are repaying me with evil. The proverbial lines are right where they say:\\n\\nWe did them good; they did its opposite,\\n\\nAnd this, by God, is how the shameless act.\\n\\nWhoever helps those who deserve no help,\\n\\nWill be like one who rescues a hyena.’\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Don’t go on so long,’ said the ‘ifrit when he heard this, ‘for death is coming to you.’ The fisherman said to himself: ‘This is a jinni and I am a human. God has given me sound intelligence which I can use to find a way of destroying him, whereas he can only use vicious cunning.’ So he asked: ‘Are you definitely going to kill me?’ and when the ‘ifrit confirmed this, he said: ‘I conjure you by the Greatest Name inscribed on the seal of Solomon and ask you to give me a truthful answer to a question that I have.’ ‘I shall,’ replied the ‘ifrit, who had been shaken and disturbed by the mention of the Greatest Name, and he went on: ‘Ask your question but be brief.’ The fisherman went on: ‘You say you were in this bottle, but there is not room in it for your hand or your foot, much less all the rest of you.’ ‘You don’t believe that I was in it?’ asked the ‘ifrit, to which the fisherman replied: ‘I shall never believe it until I see it with my own eyes.’\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.': [0.60592043], 'When it was the second night, Dunyazad said to Shahrazad: ‘Sister, finish your story of the merchant and the ‘ifrit for us.’ ‘With pleasure,’ replied Shahrazad, ‘if the king gives me permission,’ and when the king gave it, SHE WENT ON:\\n\\nI have heard, O fortunate king and rightly guided ruler, that when the merchant was about to cut the throat of the calf, he was moved by pity and told the herdsman to keep the calf among the other beasts.\\n\\nThe ‘ifrit was listening with astonishment to what the old man with the gazelle was saying, AND THE MAN WENT ON:\\n\\nLord of the kings of the jinn, while all this was going on, my wife, now this gazelle, was looking on and telling me to kill the calf, because it was fat, but I could not bring myself to do this and so I told the herdsman to take it away, which he did. The next day, as I was sitting there, he came back to me and said: ‘I have something to tell you that will please you, and you owe me a reward for my good news.’ I agreed to this and he went on: ‘Master, I have a daughter who, as a young girl, was taught magic by an old woman we had staying with us. Yesterday when you gave me the calf, I went to the girl and, when she saw it, she covered her face, shed tears but then burst into laughter. Then she said: “Father, do you hold me so cheap that you bring strange men in to me?” “Where are these strange men,” I asked, “and why are you laughing and crying?” She said: “This calf you have with you is our master’s son, who is under a spell laid upon him and his mother by his father’s wife. This is why I was laughing, but the reason why I wept was that his father killed his mother.” I was astonished by this and as soon as I found that it was morning, I came to tell you.’\\n\\nWhen I heard what the man had to say, I went out with him, drunk, although not on wine, with the joy and delight that I was feeling. When I got to his house his daughter welcomed me, kissing my hands, while the calf came and rolled on the ground in front of me. I asked her: ‘Is what you say about this calf true?’ ‘Yes, master,’ she assured me. ‘This is your darling son.’ ‘Girl,’ I told her, ‘if you free him, you can have all the beasts and everything else that your father looks after.’ She smiled and said: ‘Master, I only want this on two conditions, the first being that you marry me to him and the second that I be allowed to put a spell on the one who enchanted him and keep her confined, for otherwise I shall not be safe from her scheming.’\\n\\nWhen I heard what she had to say, I promised to give her what she wanted as well as everything that was in her father’s charge, adding that I would even give her permission to kill my wife. At that, she took a bowl, filled it with water and recited a spell over it, after which she sprinkled the water over the calf, saying: ‘If you are a calf and this is how Almighty God created you, stay in this shape and don’t change, but if you are under a spell, then return to your original shape with the permission of Almighty God.’ The calf shuddered and became a man, at which I fell on him and said: ‘For God’s sake, tell me what my wife did to you and your mother.’ He told me what had happened, and I said: ‘My son, God has sent you a rescuer to restore your rights.’ I then married the herdsman’s daughter to him and she transformed my wife into this gazelle, saying: ‘This is a beautiful shape and not a brutish one, repellent to the sight.’\\n\\nThe girl stayed with us for some time until God chose to take her to Himself and my son went off to India, the country of the man with whom you have had this experience. I myself took my wife, this gazelle, and have travelled from place to place looking for news of him until fate brought me here and I saw this merchant sitting weeping. This is my story.\\n\\n‘It is indeed a marvellous tale,’ the ‘ifrit agreed, ‘and I grant you a third share in his blood.’\\n\\nAt this point, the old man with the two Salukis came up and asked the ‘ifrit: ‘If I tell you what happened to me and my brothers, these two dogs, and you find it the most amazing and astonishing of stories, will you transfer to me a third of this man’s offence?’ The ‘ifrit agreed AND THE MAN BEGAN:\\n\\nLord of the kings of the jinn, these two dogs are my brothers, I being the third. On his death my father left us three thousand dinars and each one of us opened a shop for trade. I had not been there for long before my eldest brother, now one of these dogs, sold the contents of his shop for a thousand dinars, bought trade goods and set off on his travels.\\n\\nHe had been away for a whole year when one day as I was in my shop a beggar came up to me and stopped. I wished him well, but he said, in tears: ‘Don’t you know me any more?’ When I looked at him closely, I saw that this was my brother and so I got up to welcome him and brought him into the shop. I asked him how he was and he said: ‘Don’t ask. My wealth has gone and my circumstances have changed.’ I took him to the baths, gave him some of my own clothes and then brought him back home. Then I checked my accounts and the sales figures of my shop and I found that I had made a profit of a thousand dinars on a capital of two thousand. I divided this with my brother, telling him to forget that he had ever travelled abroad. He took the money gladly and opened another shop.\\n\\nSome time later, my second brother, now this other dog, sold everything he had, with the intention of travelling. We tried unsuccessfully to stop him, but he bought trade goods and set out with some others. He too spent a whole year away before coming back to me in the same state as his brother. ‘Brother,’ I told him, ‘didn’t I tell you not to go?’ But he replied: ‘This was something decreed by fate, and here am I, a poor man, penniless and without even a shirt.’ I took him to the baths and gave him a new suit of my own clothes to put on, before bringing him to my shop, where we then ate and drank. I told him: ‘Brother, I check the accounts of my shop once every new year and any surplus I find I shall share with you.’ When I did my audit, I found that I had two thousand dinars, and after praising the Exalted Creator, I gave him a thousand and kept the other thousand myself.\\n\\nMy brother opened another shop, but after a time he and my other brother proposed that I should go off with them on a voyage. I refused, asking: ‘What did you get from your travels to make me imagine that I could make a profit?’ I refused to listen to them and we stayed there trading in our shops. Every year they would make the same proposal to me and I would not agree, until after six years I finally accepted and told them I would go with them. I asked them to show me what money they had, only to find that they had nothing at all, having squandered everything on food, drink and entertainment. I didn’t say a word to them but checked the accounts of my shop and sold what I owned together with all my shop goods, leaving me, to my delight, with a total of six thousand dinars. I divided this in half, telling my brothers that they and I could have three thousand dinars with which to trade, while I would bury the remaining three thousand in case the same thing happened to me as had happened to them. In that case I would have money left over to allow us to reopen our shops. They agreed to this and I handed each of them a thousand dinars, keeping a thousand for myself.\\n\\nWe provided ourselves with what we had to have in the way of trade goods and made our preparations for travel, hiring a ship and loading our goods on board. After a whole month’s journey we brought them to a city, where they fetched us a ten-fold profit. We were about to sail off again when on the shore we came across a girl dressed in rags and tatters. She kissed my hand and asked if I was a charitable man, in which case she would reward me. ‘I love charity and good deeds,’ I told her, ‘even if you give me no reward.’ ‘Marry me, master,’ she said, ‘and take me to your country. I have given myself to you; treat me kindly, for I am someone who deserves kindness and generosity. I shall pay you back for this and don’t be misled by the state I am in now.’\\n\\nWhen I heard this, I felt a yearning for her, as God, the Great and Glorious, had decreed, and so I took her, gave her clothes and provided her with elegantly furnished accommodation on the ship. I treated her with respect and as our journey went on I fell so deeply in love with her that I could not bear to leave her by night or by day. In my concern for her I neglected my brothers, who grew jealous of me, envying my wealth and the quantity of my goods. They spent their time eyeing all this, and they discussed killing me and taking what I had, saying: ‘Let us kill our brother and then all this will be ours.’ Satan made this seem good to them and so, finding me alone and asleep by the side of my wife, they picked us both up and threw us overboard.\\n\\nMy wife woke; a shudder ran through her and she became an ‘ifrita. She then carried me to an island where she left me for a time before coming back at dawn and saying: ‘I am your servant and it was I who saved your life by carrying you off, with the permission of Almighty God. You must know that I am one of the jinn and when I saw you I fell in love with you, as God had decreed. For I believe in Him and in His Apostle, may God bless him and give him peace. I came to you wearing rags, as you saw, but you married me and now I have saved you from drowning. I am angry with your brothers and will have to kill them.’\\n\\nI was astonished to hear this and I thanked her for what she had done but forbade her to kill my brothers. I then told her the whole story of my dealings with them and this prompted her to say: ‘Tonight I shall fly off to them, sink their ship and destroy them.’ I implored her in God’s Name not to do that, reminding her of the proverb that tells those who do good to those who wrong them – ‘The evil-doer’s own deeds are punishment enough for him’ – and pointing out that, at all events, they were my brothers. She continued to insist, despite my pleading with her, and she then flew off with me and put me down on the roof of my own house. I opened the doors, brought out the money that I had buried and opened up my shop, after greeting the people there and buying goods for trade.\\n\\nWhen I went home that evening, I found these two dogs tied up and when they caught sight of me they came up with tears in their eyes and attached themselves to me. Before I realized what was happening, my wife told me: ‘These are your brothers.’ ‘Who did this to them?’ I asked, and she said: ‘I sent a message to my sister; it was she who transformed them, and they will not be freed from the spell for ten years.’ My brothers have now been like this for ten years and I was on my way to get them released when I came across this man. He told me his story and I decided not to leave him until I saw what was going to happen between you and him. This is my tale.\\n\\n‘It is a marvellous one,’ agreed the ‘ifrit, adding: ‘I grant you a third share in the blood he owes for his crime.’\\n\\nThe third old man, with the mule, now said: ‘If I tell you a more amazing story than these two, will you grant me the remaining share?’ The ‘ifrit agreed AND THE MAN WENT ON:\\n\\nSultan and leader of the jinn, this mule was my wife. I had been away for a year on my travels, and when I had finished I came back to her. This was at night and I saw a black slave lying in bed with her; the two of them talked, flirted, laughed, kissed and played with each other. My wife caught sight of me and came to me with a jug of water over which she uttered a spell. She sprinkled the water over me and said: ‘Leave this shape of yours and take the form of a dog.’ Immediately I became a dog and she drove me out through the door of the house.\\n\\nI went on until I came to a butcher’s shop, where I started gnawing bones. The butcher saw me and took me into his house, where his daughter covered her face from me and said: ‘Are you bringing a man in to me?’ ‘Where is there a man?’ asked her father, and she said: ‘This dog is a man over whom his wife has cast a spell, but I can free him from it.’ ‘Do that, for God’s sake,’ said her father, and she took a jug of water, spoke some words over it and sprinkled some of it on me. ‘Go back to your original shape,’ she said, and that is what I did.\\n\\nI kissed the girl’s hand and said: ‘I would like you to use your magic to do to my wife what she did to me.’ She gave me some water and told me: ‘When you find her asleep, sprinkle this water over her and say what you like, for she will become whatever you want.’ I took the water and went to my wife, whom I found sleeping. I sprinkled her with the water and said: ‘Leave this shape and become a mule,’ which she did there and then, and it is she whom you can see, sultan and chief of the kings of the jinn.\\n\\n*\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Is that true?’ the man asked the mule, at which it nodded its head, conveying by gesture the message: ‘That is my story and that is what happened to me.’ When the old man had finished his tale, the ‘ifrit, trembling with delight, granted him a third of the merchant’s blood.\\n\\nMorning now dawned and Shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say. ‘What a good, pleasant, delightful and sweet story this is!’ exclaimed Dunyazad, at which Shahrazad told her: ‘How can this compare with what I shall tell you this coming night, if I am still alive and the king spares me?’ ‘By God,’ the king said to himself, ‘I am not going to kill her until I hear the rest of this remarkable story,’ and so they spent the rest of the time embracing one another until the sun had fully risen. The king then went to his court; the troops arrived together with the vizier, and when everyone was there, he gave his judgements, appointing some officials, dismissing others, and issuing orders and prohibitions until evening. The court was then dismissed and the king returned to his palace, where, when night came, he lay again with Shahrazad.': [0.59449226]}\n"

      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that after the sorceress had taken water from the pool and spoken some unintelligible words over it, the fish danced, lifted their heads and immediately rose up, as the magic spell was removed from the city. It became inhabited again, the merchants buying and selling and each man practising his craft, while the islands were restored to their former state. The sorceress went straight away to the tomb and said to the king: ‘Give me your noble hand, my darling, and get up.’ In a low voice, the king replied: ‘Come to me.’ When she did this he, with the drawn sword in his hand, struck her in the breast as she clung on to him, so that it emerged gleaming from her back. With another blow he cut her in two, and threw the two halves on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came out he found the young man whom she had enchanted standing waiting for him, congratulating him on his escape, kissing his hand and thanking him. The king asked him whether he would prefer to stay in his own city, or to go with him to his. ‘King of the age,’ said the young man, ‘do you know how long a journey it is to your city?’ ‘Two and a half days,’ replied the king. ‘If you have been sleeping,’ said the young man, ‘wake up. Between you and your city is a full year’s worth of hard travelling. You only got here in two and a half days because this place was under a spell. But I shall not part from you for the blink of an eye.’ The king was glad and said: ‘Praise be to God, Who has given you to me. You shall be my son, for all my life I have been granted no other.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They embraced with great joy and then walked to the palace. Here the young man told his courtiers to make ready for a journey and to collect supplies and whatever was needed. This took ten days, after which the young man and the king set off, the latter being in a fever of anxiety to get back his own city. They travelled with fifty mamluks and magnificent gifts, and their journey continued day and night for a whole year until, as God had decreed their safety, they eventually reached their goal. Word was sent to the vizier that the king had arrived safe and sound, and he, together with his soldiers, who had despaired of him, came to greet him, kissing the ground before him and congratulating him on his safe arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king then entered the city to take his seat on his throne, and the vizier, on presenting himself and hearing of all that had happened to the young man, added his own congratulations. Then, when things were settled, the king presented gifts to many people and he told the vizier to fetch the man who had brought him the fish and who had been responsible for saving the people of the enchanted city. A messenger was sent to him and when he was brought to the palace, the king presented him with robes of honour and asked him about his circumstances, and whether he had any children. The fisherman replied that he had two daughters and one son. The king sent for them and married one of the girls himself, giving the other to the young man. The fisherman’s son was made treasurer, while the vizier was invested and sent off as ruler of the capital of the Black Islands, the young man’s city. With him were sent the fifty mamluks who had come with the king, and he was given robes of honour to take to the emirs of the city. He kissed the king’s hands and started out immediately, while the king remained with the young man. The fisherman, meanwhile, had become the richest man of his age, while his daughters remained as wives of kings until they died.\n",

      "This, however, is not more remarkable than what happened to the porter. There was an unmarried porter who lived in the city of Baghdad. One day, while he was standing in the market, leaning on his basket, a woman came up to him wrapped in a silken Mosuli shawl with a floating ribbon and wearing embroidered shoes fringed with gold thread. When she raised her veil, beneath it could be seen dark eyes which, with their eyelashes and eyelids, shot soft glances, perfect in their quality. She turned to the porter and said in a sweet, clear voice: ‘Take your basket and follow me.’ Almost before he was sure of what she had said, he rushed to pick up the basket. ‘What a lucky day, a day of good fortune!’ he exclaimed, following her until she stopped by the door of a house. She knocked at it and a Christian came down to whom she gave a dinar, taking in exchange an olive-coloured jar of strained wine. She put this in the basket and said to the porter: ‘Pick this up and follow me.’ ‘By God,’ repeated the porter, ‘this is a blessed and a fortunate day!’ and he did what she told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then stopped at a fruiterer’s shop, where she bought Syrian apples, Uthmani quinces, Omani peaches, jasmine and water lilies from Syria, autumn cucumbers, lemons, sultani oranges, scented myrtle, privet flowers, camomile blossoms, red anemones, violets, pomegranate blooms and eglantine. All these she put into the porter’s basket, telling him to pick it up. This he did and he followed her until she stopped at the butcher’s, where she got the man to cut her ten ratls’ weight of meat. He did this, and after paying him, she wrapped the meat in banana leaves and put it in the basket, giving the porter his instructions. He picked up the basket and followed her to the grocer, from whom she bought pistachio kernels for making a dessert, Tihama raisins and shelled almonds. The porter was told to pick them up and to follow her. Next she stopped at the sweetmeat seller’s shop. This time she bought a bowl and filled it with all that he had – sugar cakes, doughnuts stuffed with musk, ‘soap’ cakes, lemon tarts, Maimuni tarts, ‘Zainab’s combs’, sugar fingers and ‘qadis’ snacks’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every type of pastry was piled on to a plate and put into the basket, at which the porter exclaimed: ‘If you had told me, I’d have brought a donkey with me to carry all this stuff.’ The girl smiled and gave him a cuff on the back of the neck. ‘Hurry up,’ she said. ‘Don’t talk so much and you will get your reward, if God Almighty wills it.’ Then she stopped at the perfume seller’s where she bought ten types of scented water – including rosewater, orange-flower water, waters scented with water lilies and with willow flowers – two sugar loaves, a bottle of musk-scented rosewater, a quantity of frankincense, aloes, ambergris, musk and Alexandrian candles. All of these she put in the basket, telling the porter to pick it up and follow her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He carried his basket and followed her to a handsome house, overlooking a spacious courtyard. It was a tall, pillared building, whose door had two ebony leaves, plated with red gold. The girl halted by the door, raised the veil from her face and knocked lightly, while the porter remained standing behind her, his thoughts occupied with her beauty. The door opened and, as its leaves parted, the porter looked at the person who had opened it. He saw a lady of medium height, with jutting breasts, beautiful, comely, resplendent, with a perfect and well-proportioned figure, a radiant brow, red cheeks and eyes rivalling those of a wild cow or a gazelle. Her eyebrows were like the crescent moon of the month of Sha‘ban; she had cheeks like red anemones, a mouth like the seal of Solomon, coral red lips, teeth like camomile blossoms or pearls on a string, and a gazelle-like neck. Her bosom was like an ornate fountain, with breasts like twin pomegranates; she had an elegant belly and a navel that could contain an ounce of unguent. She was as the poet described:\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the sun and the moon of the palaces,\n",
      "\n",
      "At the jewel in her nose and at her flowery splendour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your eye has not seen white on black\n",
      "\n",
      "United in beauty as in her face and in her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is rosy-cheeked; beauty proclaims her name,\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you are not fortunate enough to know of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She swayed and I laughed in wonder at her haunches,\n",
      "\n",
      "But her waist prompted my tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the porter stared at her, he lost his wits and the basket almost fell from his head. ‘Never in my life,’ he repeated, ‘have I known a more blessed day than this!’ The girl who had answered the door said to the other, who had brought the provisions: ‘Come in and take the basket from this poor porter.’ So the two girls went in, followed by the porter, and they went on until they reached a spacious, well-designed and beautiful courtyard, with additional carvings, vaulted chambers and alcoves, and furnished with sofas, wardrobes, cupboards and curtains. In the middle of it was a large pool filled with water on which floated a skiff, and at its upper end was a couch of juniper wood studded with gems over which was suspended a mosquito net of red satin, the buttons of whose fastenings were pearls as big as or bigger than hazelnuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "From within this emerged a resplendent girl of pleasing beauty, glorious as the moon, with the character of a philosopher. Her eyes were bewitching, with eyebrows like bent bows; her figure was slender and straight as the letter alif; her breath had the scent of ambergris; her lips were carnelian red, sweet as sugar; and her face would shame the light of the radiant sun. She was like one of the stars of heaven, a golden dome, an unveiled bride or a noble Bedouin lady, as described by the poet:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is as though she smiles to show stringed pearls,\n",

      "While her beauty shames the light of dawn.\n",

      "This third girl rose from the couch and walked slowly to join her sisters in the centre of the hall. ‘Why are you standing here?’ she said. ‘Take the basket from the head of this poor porter.’ The provision buyer or housekeeper came first, followed by the doorkeeper, and the third girl helped them to lower the basket, after which they emptied out its contents and put everything in its place. Then they gave the porter two dinars and told him to be off. For his part, he looked at the lovely girls, the most beautiful he had ever seen, with their equally delightful natures. There were no men with them and, as he stared in astonishment at the wine, the fruits, the scented blossoms and all the rest, he was reluctant to leave. ‘Why don’t you go?’ asked the girl. ‘Do you think that we didn’t pay you enough?’ and with that, she turned to her sister and said: ‘Give him another dinar.’ ‘By God, lady,’ said the porter, ‘it was not that I thought that the payment was too little, for my fee would not come to two dirhams, but you have taken over my heart and soul. How is it that you are alone with no men here and no pleasant companion? You know that there must be four to share a proper feast and women cannot enjoy themselves except with men. As the poet says:\n",

      "Do you not see that four things join for entertainment –\n",
      "\n",
      "Harp, lute, zither and pipe,\n",

      "These only become pleasant with another four –\n",

      "Wine, gardens, a beloved and some gold.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are three of you and so you need a fourth, who must be a man of intelligence, sensible, clever and one who can keep a secret.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The three girls were surprised by what the porter said, and they laughed at him and asked: ‘Who can produce us a man like that? We are girls and are afraid of entrusting our secrets to someone who would not keep them. We have read in an account what the poet Ibn al-Thumam once said:\n",
      "\n",

      "When the girls heard this quotation, they said: ‘You know that we have spent a great deal of money on this place. Do you have anything with you which you can use to pay us back? We shall not let you sit with us as our companion and to look on our comely and beautiful faces until you pay down some money. Have you not heard what the author of the proverb said: “Love without cash is worthless”?’ The doorkeeper said: ‘My dear, if you have something, you are someone, but if you have nothing, then go without anything.’ At that point, however, the housekeeper said: ‘Sisters, let him be. For, by God, he has not failed us today, whereas someone else might not have put up with us, and whatever debt he may run up, I will settle for him.’ The porter was delighted and thanked her, kissing the ground, but the girl who had been on the couch said: ‘By God, we shall only let you sit with us on one condition, which is that you ask no questions about what does not concern you, and if you are inquisitive you will be beaten.’ ‘I agree, lady,’ said the porter. ‘I swear by my head and my eye, and here I am, a man with no tongue.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper then got up, tucked up her skirts, set out the wine bottles and strained the wine. She set green herbs beside the wine-jar and brought everything that might be needed. She then brought out the wine-jar and sat down with her two sisters, while the porter, sitting between the three of them, thought he must be dreaming. From the wine-jar that she had fetched she filled a cup, drank it, and followed it with a second and a third. Then she filled the cup and passed it to her sister and finally to the porter. She recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink with pleasure and the enjoyment of good health,\n",
      "\n",
      "For this wine is a cure for all disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The porter took the cup in his hand, bowed, thanked her and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine should be drunk beside a trusted friend,\n",
      "\n",
      "One of pure birth from the line of old heroes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For wine is like the wind, sweet if it passes scented flowers,\n",
      "\n",
      "But stinking if it blows over a corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "Take wine only from a fawn,\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtle in meaning when she speaks to you,\n",
      "\n",
      "Resembling the wine itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had recited these lines, he kissed the hand of each of the girls. Then he drank until he became tipsy, after which he swayed and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "The only blood we are allowed to drink\n",
      "\n",
      "Is blood that comes from grapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So pour this out for me, and may my life\n",
      "\n",
      "And all I have, both new and old,\n",
      "\n",
      "Serve to ransom your gazelle-like eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the housekeeper took the cup, filled it and gave it to the doorkeeper, who took it from him with thanks and drank it. She then filled it for the lady of the house, before pouring another cup and passing it to the porter, who kissed the ground in front of her, thanked her and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fetch wine, by God; bring me the brimming glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour it for me; this is the water of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went up to the mistress of the house and said: ‘Lady, I am your slave, your mamluk and your servant.’ He recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "By the door there stands a slave of yours,\n",
      "\n",
      "Acknowledging your kindly charity.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied: ‘Enjoy yourself, drink with pleasure and the well-being that follows the path of health.’ He took the cup, kissed her hand and chanted:\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave her old wine, coloured like her cheeks,\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmixed and gleaming like a fiery brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "She kissed it and said, laughingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How can you pour us people’s cheeks?’\n",
      "\n",
      "I said: ‘Drink: this comes from my tears;\n",
      "\n",
      "Its redness is my blood;\n",
      "\n",
      "My breath has heated it within the glass.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied with the line:\n",
      "\n",
      "Companion, if you have wept blood for me,\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour it obediently for me to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She then took the cup, drank it and sat down with her sister. They continued to drink, with the porter seated between them, and as they drank, they danced, laughed and sang, reciting poems and lyrics. The porter began to play with them, kissing, biting, rubbing, feeling, touching and taking liberties. One of them would give him morsels to eat, another would cuff him and slap him, and the third would bring him scented flowers. With them he was enjoying the pleasantest of times, as though he was seated among the houris of Paradise.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went on in this way until the wine had taken its effect on their heads and their brains. When it had got the upper hand of them, the doorkeeper stood up, stripped off her clothes until she was naked, and letting down her hair as a veil, she jumped into the pool. She sported in the water, ducking her head and then spitting out the water, after which she took some in her mouth and spat it over the porter. She washed her limbs and between her thighs, after which she came out from the water and threw herself down on his lap. ‘My master, my darling, what is the name of this?’ she said, pointing to her vagina. ‘Your womb,’ he replied. ‘Oh!’ she said. ‘Have you no shame?’ and she seized him by the neck and started to cuff him. ‘Your vagina,’ he said, and she cuffed him again on the back of his neck, saying: ‘Oh! Oh! How disgusting! Aren’t you ashamed?’ ‘Your vulva,’ he replied. ‘Do you feel no shame for your honour?’ and she struck him a blow with her hand. ‘Your hornet,’ he said, at which the lady of the house pounced on him and beat him, saying: ‘Don’t speak like that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "With every new name that he produced, the girls beat him more and more, until the back of his neck had almost dissolved under their slaps. They were laughing among themselves, until he asked: ‘What do you call it, then?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ replied the doorkeeper. ‘Thank God, I am safe now,’ said the porter. ‘Good for you, mint of the dykes.’ Then the wine was passed round again, and the housekeeper got up, took off her clothes and threw herself on to the porter’s lap. ‘What is this called, light of my eyes?’ she asked, pointing at her private parts. ‘Your vagina,’ he said. ‘Oh, how dirty of you!’ she exclaimed, and she struck him a blow that resounded around the hall, adding: ‘Oh! Oh! Have you no shame?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he said, but blows and slaps still rained on the back of his neck. He tried another four names, but the girls kept on saying: ‘No, no!’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he repeated, and they laughed so much that they fell over backwards. Then they fell to beating his neck, saying: ‘No, that’s not its name.’ He said: ‘O my sisters, what is it called?’ ‘Husked sesame,’ they said. Then the housekeeper put her clothes back on and they sat, drinking together, with the porter groaning at the pain in his neck and shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the wine had been passed round again, the lady of the house, the most beautiful of the three, stood up and stripped off her clothes. The porter grasped the back of his neck with his hand and massaged it, saying: ‘My neck and my shoulders are common property.’ When the girl was naked, she jumped into the pool, dived under water, played around and washed herself. To the porter in her nakedness she looked like a sliver of the moon, with a face like the full moon when it rises or the dawn when it breaks. He looked at her figure, her breasts and her heavy buttocks as they swayed, while she was naked as her Lord had created her. ‘Oh! Oh!’ he said, and he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I compare your figure to a sappy branch,\n",
      "\n",
      "I load my heart with wrongs and with injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Branches are most beautiful when concealed with leaves,\n",
      "\n",
      "While you are loveliest when we meet you naked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing these lines, the girl came out of the pool and sat on the porter’s lap. She pointed at her vulva and said: ‘Little master, what is the name of this?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he replied, and when she exclaimed in disgust, he tried ‘the husked sesame’. ‘Bah!’ she said. ‘Your womb,’ he suggested. ‘Oh! Oh! Aren’t you ashamed?’ and she slapped the back of his neck. Whatever name he produced, she slapped him, saying: ‘No, no,’ until he asked: ‘Sisters, what is it called?’ ‘The khan of Abu Mansur,’ they replied. ‘Praise God that I have reached safety at last,’ he said. ‘Ho for the khan of Abu Mansur!’ The girl got up and put on her clothes and they all went back to what they had been doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a time the wine circulated among them and the porter then got up, undressed and went into the pool. The girls looked at him swimming in the water and washing under his beard and beneath his armpits, as they had done. Then he came out and threw himself into the lap of the lady of the house, with his arms in the lap of the doorkeeper and his feet and legs in the lap of the girl who had bought the provisions. Then he pointed to his penis and said: ‘Ladies, what is the name of this?’ They all laughed at this until they fell over backwards. ‘Your zubb,’ one of them suggested. ‘No,’ he said, and he bit each of them. ‘Your air,’ they said, but he repeated ‘No’, and embraced each of them.\n",

      "Then when it was the ninth night, SHE CONTINUED:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard, O auspicious king, that after the sorceress had taken water from the pool and spoken some unintelligible words over it, the fish danced, lifted their heads and immediately rose up, as the magic spell was removed from the city. It became inhabited again, the merchants buying and selling and each man practising his craft, while the islands were restored to their former state. The sorceress went straight away to the tomb and said to the king: ‘Give me your noble hand, my darling, and get up.’ In a low voice, the king replied: ‘Come to me.’ When she did this he, with the drawn sword in his hand, struck her in the breast as she clung on to him, so that it emerged gleaming from her back. With another blow he cut her in two, and threw the two halves on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came out he found the young man whom she had enchanted standing waiting for him, congratulating him on his escape, kissing his hand and thanking him. The king asked him whether he would prefer to stay in his own city, or to go with him to his. ‘King of the age,’ said the young man, ‘do you know how long a journey it is to your city?’ ‘Two and a half days,’ replied the king. ‘If you have been sleeping,’ said the young man, ‘wake up. Between you and your city is a full year’s worth of hard travelling. You only got here in two and a half days because this place was under a spell. But I shall not part from you for the blink of an eye.’ The king was glad and said: ‘Praise be to God, Who has given you to me. You shall be my son, for all my life I have been granted no other.’\n",
      "\n",
      "They embraced with great joy and then walked to the palace. Here the young man told his courtiers to make ready for a journey and to collect supplies and whatever was needed. This took ten days, after which the young man and the king set off, the latter being in a fever of anxiety to get back his own city. They travelled with fifty mamluks and magnificent gifts, and their journey continued day and night for a whole year until, as God had decreed their safety, they eventually reached their goal. Word was sent to the vizier that the king had arrived safe and sound, and he, together with his soldiers, who had despaired of him, came to greet him, kissing the ground before him and congratulating him on his safe arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king then entered the city to take his seat on his throne, and the vizier, on presenting himself and hearing of all that had happened to the young man, added his own congratulations. Then, when things were settled, the king presented gifts to many people and he told the vizier to fetch the man who had brought him the fish and who had been responsible for saving the people of the enchanted city. A messenger was sent to him and when he was brought to the palace, the king presented him with robes of honour and asked him about his circumstances, and whether he had any children. The fisherman replied that he had two daughters and one son. The king sent for them and married one of the girls himself, giving the other to the young man. The fisherman’s son was made treasurer, while the vizier was invested and sent off as ruler of the capital of the Black Islands, the young man’s city. With him were sent the fifty mamluks who had come with the king, and he was given robes of honour to take to the emirs of the city. He kissed the king’s hands and started out immediately, while the king remained with the young man. The fisherman, meanwhile, had become the richest man of his age, while his daughters remained as wives of kings until they died.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, however, is not more remarkable than what happened to the porter. There was an unmarried porter who lived in the city of Baghdad. One day, while he was standing in the market, leaning on his basket, a woman came up to him wrapped in a silken Mosuli shawl with a floating ribbon and wearing embroidered shoes fringed with gold thread. When she raised her veil, beneath it could be seen dark eyes which, with their eyelashes and eyelids, shot soft glances, perfect in their quality. She turned to the porter and said in a sweet, clear voice: ‘Take your basket and follow me.’ Almost before he was sure of what she had said, he rushed to pick up the basket. ‘What a lucky day, a day of good fortune!’ he exclaimed, following her until she stopped by the door of a house. She knocked at it and a Christian came down to whom she gave a dinar, taking in exchange an olive-coloured jar of strained wine. She put this in the basket and said to the porter: ‘Pick this up and follow me.’ ‘By God,’ repeated the porter, ‘this is a blessed and a fortunate day!’ and he did what she told him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then stopped at a fruiterer’s shop, where she bought Syrian apples, Uthmani quinces, Omani peaches, jasmine and water lilies from Syria, autumn cucumbers, lemons, sultani oranges, scented myrtle, privet flowers, camomile blossoms, red anemones, violets, pomegranate blooms and eglantine. All these she put into the porter’s basket, telling him to pick it up. This he did and he followed her until she stopped at the butcher’s, where she got the man to cut her ten ratls’ weight of meat. He did this, and after paying him, she wrapped the meat in banana leaves and put it in the basket, giving the porter his instructions. He picked up the basket and followed her to the grocer, from whom she bought pistachio kernels for making a dessert, Tihama raisins and shelled almonds. The porter was told to pick them up and to follow her. Next she stopped at the sweetmeat seller’s shop. This time she bought a bowl and filled it with all that he had – sugar cakes, doughnuts stuffed with musk, ‘soap’ cakes, lemon tarts, Maimuni tarts, ‘Zainab’s combs’, sugar fingers and ‘qadis’ snacks’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every type of pastry was piled on to a plate and put into the basket, at which the porter exclaimed: ‘If you had told me, I’d have brought a donkey with me to carry all this stuff.’ The girl smiled and gave him a cuff on the back of the neck. ‘Hurry up,’ she said. ‘Don’t talk so much and you will get your reward, if God Almighty wills it.’ Then she stopped at the perfume seller’s where she bought ten types of scented water – including rosewater, orange-flower water, waters scented with water lilies and with willow flowers – two sugar loaves, a bottle of musk-scented rosewater, a quantity of frankincense, aloes, ambergris, musk and Alexandrian candles. All of these she put in the basket, telling the porter to pick it up and follow her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He carried his basket and followed her to a handsome house, overlooking a spacious courtyard. It was a tall, pillared building, whose door had two ebony leaves, plated with red gold. The girl halted by the door, raised the veil from her face and knocked lightly, while the porter remained standing behind her, his thoughts occupied with her beauty. The door opened and, as its leaves parted, the porter looked at the person who had opened it. He saw a lady of medium height, with jutting breasts, beautiful, comely, resplendent, with a perfect and well-proportioned figure, a radiant brow, red cheeks and eyes rivalling those of a wild cow or a gazelle. Her eyebrows were like the crescent moon of the month of Sha‘ban; she had cheeks like red anemones, a mouth like the seal of Solomon, coral red lips, teeth like camomile blossoms or pearls on a string, and a gazelle-like neck. Her bosom was like an ornate fountain, with breasts like twin pomegranates; she had an elegant belly and a navel that could contain an ounce of unguent. She was as the poet described:\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the sun and the moon of the palaces,\n",
      "\n",
      "At the jewel in her nose and at her flowery splendour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your eye has not seen white on black\n",
      "\n",
      "United in beauty as in her face and in her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is rosy-cheeked; beauty proclaims her name,\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you are not fortunate enough to know of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She swayed and I laughed in wonder at her haunches,\n",
      "\n",
      "But her waist prompted my tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the porter stared at her, he lost his wits and the basket almost fell from his head. ‘Never in my life,’ he repeated, ‘have I known a more blessed day than this!’ The girl who had answered the door said to the other, who had brought the provisions: ‘Come in and take the basket from this poor porter.’ So the two girls went in, followed by the porter, and they went on until they reached a spacious, well-designed and beautiful courtyard, with additional carvings, vaulted chambers and alcoves, and furnished with sofas, wardrobes, cupboards and curtains. In the middle of it was a large pool filled with water on which floated a skiff, and at its upper end was a couch of juniper wood studded with gems over which was suspended a mosquito net of red satin, the buttons of whose fastenings were pearls as big as or bigger than hazelnuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "From within this emerged a resplendent girl of pleasing beauty, glorious as the moon, with the character of a philosopher. Her eyes were bewitching, with eyebrows like bent bows; her figure was slender and straight as the letter alif; her breath had the scent of ambergris; her lips were carnelian red, sweet as sugar; and her face would shame the light of the radiant sun. She was like one of the stars of heaven, a golden dome, an unveiled bride or a noble Bedouin lady, as described by the poet:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is as though she smiles to show stringed pearls,\n",
      "\n",
      "Hailstones or flowers of camomile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The locks of her hair hang black as night,\n",
      "\n",
      "While her beauty shames the light of dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This third girl rose from the couch and walked slowly to join her sisters in the centre of the hall. ‘Why are you standing here?’ she said. ‘Take the basket from the head of this poor porter.’ The provision buyer or housekeeper came first, followed by the doorkeeper, and the third girl helped them to lower the basket, after which they emptied out its contents and put everything in its place. Then they gave the porter two dinars and told him to be off. For his part, he looked at the lovely girls, the most beautiful he had ever seen, with their equally delightful natures. There were no men with them and, as he stared in astonishment at the wine, the fruits, the scented blossoms and all the rest, he was reluctant to leave. ‘Why don’t you go?’ asked the girl. ‘Do you think that we didn’t pay you enough?’ and with that, she turned to her sister and said: ‘Give him another dinar.’ ‘By God, lady,’ said the porter, ‘it was not that I thought that the payment was too little, for my fee would not come to two dirhams, but you have taken over my heart and soul. How is it that you are alone with no men here and no pleasant companion? You know that there must be four to share a proper feast and women cannot enjoy themselves except with men. As the poet says:\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you not see that four things join for entertainment –\n",
      "\n",
      "Harp, lute, zither and pipe,\n",
      "\n",
      "Matched by four scented flowers –\n",
      "\n",
      "Rose, myrtle, gillyflower, anemone.\n",
      "\n",
      "These only become pleasant with another four –\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine, gardens, a beloved and some gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three of you and so you need a fourth, who must be a man of intelligence, sensible, clever and one who can keep a secret.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The three girls were surprised by what the porter said, and they laughed at him and asked: ‘Who can produce us a man like that? We are girls and are afraid of entrusting our secrets to someone who would not keep them. We have read in an account what the poet Ibn al-Thumam once said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Guard your secret as you can, entrusting it to none,\n",
      "\n",
      "For if you do, you will have let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your own breast cannot contain your secret,\n",
      "\n",
      "How is it to be held by someone else?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Abu Nuwas has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever lets the people know his secret\n",
      "\n",
      "Deserves a brand imprinted on his forehead.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the porter heard what they said, he exclaimed: ‘By God, I am an intelligent and a trustworthy man; I have read books and studied histories; I make public what is good and conceal what is bad. As the poet says:\n",
      "\n",
      "Only the trustworthy can keep a secret,\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is with the good that secrets are concealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "With me they are kept locked inside a room\n",
      "\n",
      "Whose keys are lost and whose door has been sealed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girls heard this quotation, they said: ‘You know that we have spent a great deal of money on this place. Do you have anything with you which you can use to pay us back? We shall not let you sit with us as our companion and to look on our comely and beautiful faces until you pay down some money. Have you not heard what the author of the proverb said: “Love without cash is worthless”?’ The doorkeeper said: ‘My dear, if you have something, you are someone, but if you have nothing, then go without anything.’ At that point, however, the housekeeper said: ‘Sisters, let him be. For, by God, he has not failed us today, whereas someone else might not have put up with us, and whatever debt he may run up, I will settle for him.’ The porter was delighted and thanked her, kissing the ground, but the girl who had been on the couch said: ‘By God, we shall only let you sit with us on one condition, which is that you ask no questions about what does not concern you, and if you are inquisitive you will be beaten.’ ‘I agree, lady,’ said the porter. ‘I swear by my head and my eye, and here I am, a man with no tongue.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper then got up, tucked up her skirts, set out the wine bottles and strained the wine. She set green herbs beside the wine-jar and brought everything that might be needed. She then brought out the wine-jar and sat down with her two sisters, while the porter, sitting between the three of them, thought he must be dreaming. From the wine-jar that she had fetched she filled a cup, drank it, and followed it with a second and a third. Then she filled the cup and passed it to her sister and finally to the porter. She recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Drink with pleasure and the enjoyment of good health,\n",
      "\n",
      "For this wine is a cure for all disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The porter took the cup in his hand, bowed, thanked her and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine should be drunk beside a trusted friend,\n",
      "\n",
      "One of pure birth from the line of old heroes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For wine is like the wind, sweet if it passes scented flowers,\n",
      "\n",
      "But stinking if it blows over a corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "Take wine only from a fawn,\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtle in meaning when she speaks to you,\n",
      "\n",
      "Resembling the wine itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had recited these lines, he kissed the hand of each of the girls. Then he drank until he became tipsy, after which he swayed and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "The only blood we are allowed to drink\n",
      "\n",
      "Is blood that comes from grapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So pour this out for me, and may my life\n",
      "\n",
      "And all I have, both new and old,\n",
      "\n",
      "Serve to ransom your gazelle-like eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the housekeeper took the cup, filled it and gave it to the doorkeeper, who took it from him with thanks and drank it. She then filled it for the lady of the house, before pouring another cup and passing it to the porter, who kissed the ground in front of her, thanked her and recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fetch wine, by God; bring me the brimming glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour it for me; this is the water of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went up to the mistress of the house and said: ‘Lady, I am your slave, your mamluk and your servant.’ He recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "By the door there stands a slave of yours,\n",
      "\n",
      "Acknowledging your kindly charity.\n",
      "\n",
      "May he come in, fair one, to see your loveliness?\n",
      "\n",
      "I swear by love itself I cannot leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied: ‘Enjoy yourself, drink with pleasure and the well-being that follows the path of health.’ He took the cup, kissed her hand and chanted:\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave her old wine, coloured like her cheeks,\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmixed and gleaming like a fiery brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "She kissed it and said, laughingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How can you pour us people’s cheeks?’\n",
      "\n",
      "I said: ‘Drink: this comes from my tears;\n",
      "\n",
      "Its redness is my blood;\n",
      "\n",
      "My breath has heated it within the glass.’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She replied with the line:\n",
      "\n",
      "Companion, if you have wept blood for me,\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour it obediently for me to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She then took the cup, drank it and sat down with her sister. They continued to drink, with the porter seated between them, and as they drank, they danced, laughed and sang, reciting poems and lyrics. The porter began to play with them, kissing, biting, rubbing, feeling, touching and taking liberties. One of them would give him morsels to eat, another would cuff him and slap him, and the third would bring him scented flowers. With them he was enjoying the pleasantest of times, as though he was seated among the houris of Paradise.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went on in this way until the wine had taken its effect on their heads and their brains. When it had got the upper hand of them, the doorkeeper stood up, stripped off her clothes until she was naked, and letting down her hair as a veil, she jumped into the pool. She sported in the water, ducking her head and then spitting out the water, after which she took some in her mouth and spat it over the porter. She washed her limbs and between her thighs, after which she came out from the water and threw herself down on his lap. ‘My master, my darling, what is the name of this?’ she said, pointing to her vagina. ‘Your womb,’ he replied. ‘Oh!’ she said. ‘Have you no shame?’ and she seized him by the neck and started to cuff him. ‘Your vagina,’ he said, and she cuffed him again on the back of his neck, saying: ‘Oh! Oh! How disgusting! Aren’t you ashamed?’ ‘Your vulva,’ he replied. ‘Do you feel no shame for your honour?’ and she struck him a blow with her hand. ‘Your hornet,’ he said, at which the lady of the house pounced on him and beat him, saying: ‘Don’t speak like that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "With every new name that he produced, the girls beat him more and more, until the back of his neck had almost dissolved under their slaps. They were laughing among themselves, until he asked: ‘What do you call it, then?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ replied the doorkeeper. ‘Thank God, I am safe now,’ said the porter. ‘Good for you, mint of the dykes.’ Then the wine was passed round again, and the housekeeper got up, took off her clothes and threw herself on to the porter’s lap. ‘What is this called, light of my eyes?’ she asked, pointing at her private parts. ‘Your vagina,’ he said. ‘Oh, how dirty of you!’ she exclaimed, and she struck him a blow that resounded around the hall, adding: ‘Oh! Oh! Have you no shame?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he said, but blows and slaps still rained on the back of his neck. He tried another four names, but the girls kept on saying: ‘No, no!’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he repeated, and they laughed so much that they fell over backwards. Then they fell to beating his neck, saying: ‘No, that’s not its name.’ He said: ‘O my sisters, what is it called?’ ‘Husked sesame,’ they said. Then the housekeeper put her clothes back on and they sat, drinking together, with the porter groaning at the pain in his neck and shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the wine had been passed round again, the lady of the house, the most beautiful of the three, stood up and stripped off her clothes. The porter grasped the back of his neck with his hand and massaged it, saying: ‘My neck and my shoulders are common property.’ When the girl was naked, she jumped into the pool, dived under water, played around and washed herself. To the porter in her nakedness she looked like a sliver of the moon, with a face like the full moon when it rises or the dawn when it breaks. He looked at her figure, her breasts and her heavy buttocks as they swayed, while she was naked as her Lord had created her. ‘Oh! Oh!’ he said, and he recited:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I compare your figure to a sappy branch,\n",
      "\n",
      "I load my heart with wrongs and with injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Branches are most beautiful when concealed with leaves,\n",
      "\n",
      "While you are loveliest when we meet you naked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On hearing these lines, the girl came out of the pool and sat on the porter’s lap. She pointed at her vulva and said: ‘Little master, what is the name of this?’ ‘The mint of the dykes,’ he replied, and when she exclaimed in disgust, he tried ‘the husked sesame’. ‘Bah!’ she said. ‘Your womb,’ he suggested. ‘Oh! Oh! Aren’t you ashamed?’ and she slapped the back of his neck. Whatever name he produced, she slapped him, saying: ‘No, no,’ until he asked: ‘Sisters, what is it called?’ ‘The khan of Abu Mansur,’ they replied. ‘Praise God that I have reached safety at last,’ he said. ‘Ho for the khan of Abu Mansur!’ The girl got up and put on her clothes and they all went back to what they had been doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a time the wine circulated among them and the porter then got up, undressed and went into the pool. The girls looked at him swimming in the water and washing under his beard and beneath his armpits, as they had done. Then he came out and threw himself into the lap of the lady of the house, with his arms in the lap of the doorkeeper and his feet and legs in the lap of the girl who had bought the provisions. Then he pointed to his penis and said: ‘Ladies, what is the name of this?’ They all laughed at this until they fell over backwards. ‘Your zubb,’ one of them suggested. ‘No,’ he said, and he bit each of them. ‘Your air,’ they said, but he repeated ‘No’, and embraced each of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

thanking him.', 'the king asked him whether he would prefer to stay in his own city, or to go with him to his.', '‘king of the age,’ said the young man, ‘do you know how long a journey it is to your city?’ ‘two and a half days,’ replied the king.', '‘if you have been sleeping,’ said the young man, ‘wake up.', 'between you and your city is a full year’s worth of hard travelling.', 'you only got here in two and a half days because this place was under a spell.', 'but i shall not part from you for the blink of an eye.’ the king was glad and said: ‘praise be to god, who has given you to me.',

journey and to collect supplies and whatever was needed.', 'this took ten days, after which the young man and the king set off, the latter being in a fever of anxiety to get back his own city.', 'they travelled with fifty mamluks and magnificent gifts, and their journey continued day and night for a whole year until, as god had decreed their safety, they eventually reached their goal.', 'word was sent to the vizier that the king had arrived safe and sound, and he, together with his soldiers, who had despaired of him, came to greet him, kissing the ground before him and congratulating him on his safe arrival.', 'the king then entered the city to take his seat on his throne, and the vizier, on presenting himself and hearing of all that had happened to the young man, added his own congratulations.', 'then, when things were settled, the king presented gifts to many people and he told the vizier to fetch the man who had brought him the fish and who had been responsible for saving the people of the enchanted city.', 'a messenger was sent to him and when he was brought to the palace, the king presented him with robes of honour and asked him about his circumstances, and whether he had any children.', 'the fisherman replied that he had two daughters and one son.', 'the king sent for them and married one of the girls himself, giving the other to the young man.', 'the fisherman’s son was made treasurer, while the vizier was invested and sent off as ruler of the capital of the black islands, the young man’s city.', 'with him were sent the fifty mamluks who had come with the king, and he was given robes of honour to take to the emirs of the city.', 'he kissed the king’s hands and started out immediately, while the king remained with the young man.', 'the fisherman, meanwhile, had become the richest man of his age, while his daughters remained as wives of kings until they died.', 'this, however, is not more remarkable than what happened to the porter.', 'there was an unmarried porter who lived in the city of baghdad.', 'one day, while he was standing in the market, leaning on his basket, a woman came up to him wrapped in a silken mosuli shawl with a floating ribbon and wearing embroidered shoes fringed with gold thread.', 'when she raised her veil, beneath it could be seen dark eyes which, with their eyelashes and eyelids, shot soft glances, perfect in their quality.', 'she turned to the porter and said in a sweet, clear voice: ‘take your basket and follow me.’ almost before he was sure of what she had said, he rushed to pick up the basket.', '‘what a lucky day, a day of good fortune!’ he exclaimed, following her until she stopped by the door of a house.', 'she knocked at it and a christian came down to whom she gave a dinar, taking in exchange an olive-coloured jar of strained wine.', 'she put this in the basket and said to the porter: ‘pick this up and follow me.’ ‘by god,’ repeated the porter, ‘this is a blessed and a fortunate day!’ and he did what she told him.', 'she then stopped at a fruiterer’s shop, where she bought syrian apples, uthmani quinces, omani peaches, jasmine and water lilies from syria, autumn cucumbers, lemons, sultani oranges, scented myrtle, privet flowers, camomile blossoms, red anemones, violets, pomegranate blooms and eglantine.', 'all these she put into the porter’s basket, telling him to pick it up.', 'this he did and he followed her until she stopped at the butcher’s, where she got the man to cut her ten ratls’ weight of meat.', 'he did this, and after paying him, she wrapped the meat in banana leaves and put it in the basket, giving the porter his instructions.', 'he picked up the basket and followed her to the grocer, from whom she bought pistachio kernels for making a dessert, tihama raisins and shelled almonds.', 'the porter was told to pick them up and to follow her.', 'next she stopped at the sweetmeat seller’s shop.', 'this time she bought a bowl and filled it with all that he had – sugar cakes, doughnuts stuffed with musk, ‘soap’ cakes, lemon tarts, maimuni tarts, ‘zainab’s combs’, sugar fingers and ‘qadis’ snacks’.', 'every type of pastry was piled on to a plate and put into the basket, at which the porter exclaimed: ‘if you had told me, i’d have brought a donkey with me to carry all this stuff.’ the girl smiled and gave him a cuff on the back of the neck.', '‘hurry up,’ she said.', '‘don’t talk so much and you will get your reward, if god almighty wills it.’ then she stopped at the perfume seller’s where she bought ten types of scented water – including rosewater, orange-flower water, waters scented with water lilies and with willow flowers – two sugar loaves, a bottle of musk-scented rosewater, a quantity of frankincense, aloes, ambergris, musk and alexandrian candles.', 'all of these she put in the basket, telling the porter to pick it up and follow her.', 'he carried his basket and followed her to a handsome house, overlooking a spacious courtyard.', 'it was a tall, pillared building, whose door had two ebony leaves, plated with red gold.', 'the girl halted by the door, raised the veil from her face and knocked lightly, while the porter remained standing behind her, his thoughts occupied with her beauty.', 'the door opened and, as its leaves parted, the porter looked at the person who had opened it.', 'he saw a lady of medium height, with jutting breasts, beautiful, comely, resplendent, with a perfect and well-proportioned figure, a radiant brow, red cheeks and eyes rivalling those of a wild cow or a gazelle.', 'her eyebrows were like the crescent moon of the month of sha‘ban; she had cheeks like red anemones, a mouth like the seal of solomon, coral red lips, teeth like camomile blossoms or pearls on a string, and a gazelle-like neck.', 'her bosom was like an ornate fountain, with breasts like twin pomegranates; she had an elegant belly and a navel that could contain an ounce of unguent.', 'she was as the poet described:\\n\\nlook at the sun and the moon of the palaces,\\n\\nat the jewel in her nose and at her flowery splendour.', 'your eye has not seen white on black\\n\\nunited in beauty as in her face and in her hair.', 'she is rosy-cheeked; beauty proclaims her name,\\n\\neven if you are not fortunate enough to know of her.', 'she swayed and i laughed in wonder at her haunches,\\n\\nbut her waist prompted my tears.', 'as the porter stared at her, he lost his wits and the basket almost fell from his head.', '‘never in my life,’ he repeated, ‘have i known a more blessed day than this!’ the girl who had answered the door said to the other, who had brought the provisions: ‘come in and take the basket from this poor porter.’ so the two girls went in, followed by the porter, and they went on until they reached a spacious, well-designed and beautiful courtyard, with additional carvings, vaulted chambers and alcoves, and furnished with sofas, wardrobes, cupboards and curtains.', 'in the middle of it was a large pool filled with water on which floated a skiff, and at its upper end was a couch of juniper wood studded with gems over which was suspended a mosquito net of red satin, the buttons of whose fastenings were pearls as big as or bigger than hazelnuts.', 'from within this emerged a resplendent girl of pleasing beauty, glorious as the moon, with the character of a philosopher.', 'her eyes were bewitching, with eyebrows like bent bows; her figure was slender and straight as the letter alif; her breath had the scent of ambergris; her lips were carnelian red, sweet as sugar; and her face would shame the light of the radiant sun.', 'she was like one of the stars of heaven, a golden dome, an unveiled bride or a noble bedouin lady, as described by the poet:\\n\\nit is as though she smiles to show stringed pearls,\\n\\nhailstones or flowers of camomile.', 'the locks of her hair hang black as night,\\n\\nwhile her beauty shames the light of dawn.', 'this third girl rose from the couch and walked slowly to join her sisters in the centre of the hall.', '‘why are you standing here?’ she said.', '‘take the basket from the head of this poor porter.’ the provision buyer or housekeeper came first, followed by the doorkeeper, and the third girl helped them to lower the basket, after which they emptied out its contents and put everything in its place.', 'then they gave the porter two dinars and told him to be off.', 'for his part, he looked at the lovely girls, the most beautiful he had ever seen, with their equally delightful natures.', 'there were no men with them and, as he stared in astonishment at the wine, the fruits, the scented blossoms and all the rest, he was reluctant to leave.', '‘why don’t you go?’ asked the girl.', '‘do you think that we didn’t pay you enough?’ and with that, she turned to her sister and said: ‘give him another dinar.’ ‘by god, lady,’ said the porter, ‘it was not that i thought that the payment was too little, for my fee would not come to two dirhams, but you have taken over my heart and soul.', 'how is it that you are alone with no men here and no pleasant companion?', 'you know that there must be four to share a proper feast and women cannot enjoy themselves except with men.', 'as the poet says:\\n\\ndo you not see that four things join for entertainment –\\n\\nharp, lute, zither and pipe,\\n\\nmatched by four scented flowers –\\n\\nrose, myrtle, gillyflower, anemone.', 'these only become pleasant with another four –\\n\\nwine, gardens, a beloved and some gold.', 'there are three of you and so you need a fourth, who must be a man of intelligence, sensible, clever and one who can keep a secret.’\\n\\nthe three girls were surprised by what the porter said, and they laughed at him and asked: ‘who can produce us a man like that?', 'we are girls and are afraid of entrusting our secrets to someone who would not keep them.', 'we have read in an account what the poet ibn al-thumam once said:\\n\\nguard your secret as you can, entrusting it to none,\\n\\nfor if you do, you will have let it go.', 'if your own breast cannot contain your secret,\\n\\nhow is it to be held by someone else?', 'and abu nuwas has said:\\n\\nwhoever lets the people know his secret\\n\\ndeserves a brand imprinted on his forehead.’\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen the porter heard what they said, he exclaimed: ‘by god, i am an intelligent and a trustworthy man; i have read books and studied histories; i make public what is good and conceal what is bad.', 'as the poet says:\\n\\nonly the trustworthy can keep a secret,\\n\\nand it is with the good that secrets are concealed.', 'with me they are kept locked inside a room\\n\\nwhose keys are lost and whose door has been sealed.’\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen the girls heard this quotation, they said: ‘you know that we have spent a great deal of money on this place.', 'do you have anything with you which you can use to pay us back?', 'we shall not let you sit with us as our companion and to look on our comely and beautiful faces until you pay down some money.', 'have you not heard what the author of the proverb said: “love without cash is worthless”?’ the doorkeeper said: ‘my dear, if you have something, you are someone, but if you have nothing, then go without anything.’ at that point, however, the housekeeper said: ‘sisters, let him be.', 'for, by god, he has not failed us today, whereas someone else might not have put up with us, and whatever debt he may run up, i will settle for him.’ the porter was delighted and thanked her, kissing the ground, but the girl who had been on the couch said: ‘by god, we shall only let you sit with us on one condition, which is that you ask no questions about what does not concern you, and if you are inquisitive you will be beaten.’ ‘i agree, lady,’ said the porter.', '‘i swear by my head and my eye, and here i am, a man with no tongue.’\\n\\nthe housekeeper then got up, tucked up her skirts, set out the wine bottles and strained the wine.', 'she set green herbs beside the wine-jar and brought everything that might be needed.', 'she then brought out the wine-jar and sat down with her two sisters, while the porter, sitting between the three of them, thought he must be dreaming.', 'from the wine-jar that she had fetched she filled a cup, drank it, and followed it with a second and a third.', 'then she filled the cup and passed it to her sister and finally to the porter.', 'she recited:\\n\\ndrink with pleasure and the enjoyment of good health,\\n\\nfor this wine is a cure for all disease.', 'the porter took the cup in his hand, bowed, thanked her and recited:\\n\\nwine should be drunk beside a trusted friend,\\n\\none of pure birth from the line of old heroes.', 'for wine is like the wind, sweet if it passes scented flowers,\\n\\nbut stinking if it blows over a corpse.', 'then he added:\\n\\ntake wine only from a fawn,\\n\\nsubtle in meaning when she speaks to you,\\n\\nresembling the wine itself.', 'after he had recited these lines, he kissed the hand of each of the girls.', 'then he drank until he became tipsy, after which he swayed and recited:\\n\\nthe only blood we are allowed to drink\\n\\nis blood that comes from grapes.', 'so pour this out for me, and may my life\\n\\nand all i have, both new and old,\\n\\nserve to ransom your gazelle-like eyes.', 'then the housekeeper took the cup, filled it and gave it to the doorkeeper, who took it from him with thanks and drank it.', 'she then filled it for the lady of the house, before pouring another cup and passing it to the porter, who kissed the ground in front of her, thanked her and recited:\\n\\nfetch wine, by god; bring me the brimming glass.', 'pour it for me; this is the water of life.', 'he then went up to the mistress of the house and said: ‘lady, i am your slave, your mamluk and your servant.’ he recited:\\n\\nby the door there stands a slave of yours,\\n\\nacknowledging your kindly charity.', 'may he come in, fair one, to see your loveliness?', 'i swear by love itself i cannot leave.', 'she replied: ‘enjoy yourself, drink with pleasure and the well-being that follows the path of health.’ he took the cup, kissed her hand and chanted:\\n\\ni gave her old wine, coloured like her cheeks,\\n\\nunmixed and gleaming like a fiery brand.', 'she kissed it and said, laughingly:\\n\\n‘how can you pour us people’s cheeks?’\\n\\ni said: ‘drink: this comes from my tears;\\n\\nits redness is my blood;\\n\\nmy breath has heated it within the glass.’\\n\\n\\n\\nshe replied with the line:\\n\\ncompanion, if you have wept blood for me,\\n\\npour it obediently for me to drink.', 'she then took the cup, drank it and sat down with her sister.', 'they continued to drink, with the porter seated between them, and as they drank, they danced, laughed and sang, reciting poems and lyrics.', 'the porter began to play with them, kissing, biting, rubbing, feeling, touching and taking liberties.', 'one of them would give him morsels to eat, another would cuff him and slap him, and the third would bring him scented flowers.', 'with them he was enjoying the pleasantest of times, as though he was seated among the houris of paradise.', 'they went on in this way until the wine had taken its effect on their heads and their brains.', 'when it had got the upper hand of them, the doorkeeper stood up, stripped off her clothes until she was naked, and letting down her hair as a veil, she jumped into the pool.', 'she sported in the water, ducking her head and then spitting out the water, after which she took some in her mouth and spat it over the porter.', 'she washed her limbs and between her thighs, after which she came out from the water and threw herself down on his lap.', '‘my master, my darling, what is the name of this?’ she said, pointing to her vagina.', '‘your womb,’ he replied.', '‘oh!’ she said.', '‘have you no shame?’ and she seized him by the neck and started to cuff him.', '‘your vagina,’ he said, and she cuffed him again on the back of his neck, saying: ‘oh!', 'oh!', 'how disgusting!', 'aren’t you ashamed?’ ‘your vulva,’ he replied.', '‘do you feel no shame for your honour?’ and she struck him a blow with her hand.', '‘your hornet,’ he said, at which the lady of the house pounced on him and beat him, saying: ‘don’t speak like that.’\\n\\nwith every new name that he produced, the girls beat him more and more, until the back of his neck had almost dissolved under their slaps.', 'they were laughing among themselves, until he asked: ‘what do you call it, then?’ ‘the mint of the dykes,’ replied the doorkeeper.', '‘thank god, i am safe now,’ said the porter.', '‘good for you, mint of the dykes.’ then the wine was passed round again, and the housekeeper got up, took off her clothes and threw herself on to the porter’s lap.', '‘what is this called, light of my eyes?’ she asked, pointing at her private parts.', '‘your vagina,’ he said.', '‘oh, how dirty of you!’ she exclaimed, and she struck him a blow that resounded around the hall, adding: ‘oh!', 'oh!', 'have you no shame?’ ‘the mint of the dykes,’ he said, but blows and slaps still rained on the back of his neck.', 'he tried another four names, but the girls kept on saying: ‘no, no!’ ‘the mint of the dykes,’ he repeated, and they laughed so much that they fell over backwards.', 'then they fell to beating his neck, saying: ‘no, that’s not its name.’ he said: ‘o my sisters, what is it called?’ ‘husked sesame,’ they said.', 'then the housekeeper put her clothes back on and they sat, drinking together, with the porter groaning at the pain in his neck and shoulders.', 'after the wine had been passed round again, the lady of the house, the most beautiful of the three, stood up and stripped off her clothes.', 'the porter grasped the back of his neck with his hand and massaged it, saying: ‘my neck and my shoulders are common property.’ when the girl was naked, she jumped into the pool, dived under water, played around and washed herself.', 'to the porter in her nakedness she looked like a sliver of the moon, with a face like the full moon when it rises or the dawn when it breaks.', 'he looked at her figure, her breasts and her heavy buttocks as they swayed, while she was naked as her lord had created her.', '‘oh!', 'oh!’ he said, and he recited:\\n\\nif i compare your figure to a sappy branch,\\n\\ni load my heart with wrongs and with injustice.', 'branches are most beautiful when concealed with leaves,\\n\\nwhile you are loveliest when we meet you naked.', 'on hearing these lines, the girl came out of the pool and sat on the porter’s lap.', 'she pointed at her vulva and said: ‘little master, what is the name of this?’ ‘the mint of the dykes,’ he replied, and when she exclaimed in disgust, he tried ‘the husked sesame’.', '‘bah!’ she said.', '‘your womb,’ he suggested.', '‘oh!', 'oh!', 'aren’t you ashamed?’ and she slapped the back of his neck.', 'whatever name he produced, she slapped him, saying: ‘no, no,’ until he asked: ‘sisters, what is it called?’ ‘the khan of abu mansur,’ they replied.', '‘praise god that i have reached safety at last,’ he said.', '‘ho for the khan of abu mansur!’ the girl got up and put on her clothes and they all went back to what they had been doing.', 'for a time the wine circulated among them and the porter then got up, undressed and went into the pool.', 'the girls looked at him swimming in the water and washing under his beard and beneath his armpits, as they had done.', 'then he came out and threw himself into the lap of the lady of the house, with his arms in the lap of the doorkeeper and his feet and legs in the lap of the girl who had bought the provisions.', 'then he pointed to his penis and said: ‘ladies, what is the name of this?’ they all laughed at this until they fell over backwards.', '‘your zubb,’ one of them suggested.', '‘no,’ he said, and he bit each of them.', '‘your air,’ they said, but he repeated ‘no’, and embraced each of them.', 'morning now dawned and shahrazad broke off from what she had been allowed to say.']\n"

       " 'he saw a lady of medium height, with jutting breasts, beautiful, comely, resplendent, with a perfect and well-proportioned figure, a radiant brow, red cheeks and eyes rivalling those of a wild cow or a gazelle.',\n",
       " 'her eyebrows were like the crescent moon of the month of sha‘ban; she had cheeks like red anemones, a mouth like the seal of solomon, coral red lips, teeth like camomile blossoms or pearls on a string, and a gazelle-like neck.',\n",
       " 'her bosom was like an ornate fountain, with breasts like twin pomegranates; she had an elegant belly and a navel that could contain an ounce of unguent.',\n",
       " 'she was as the poet described:\\n\\nlook at the sun and the moon of the palaces,\\n\\nat the jewel in her nose and at her flowery splendour.',\n",
       " 'your eye has not seen white on black\\n\\nunited in beauty as in her face and in her hair.',\n",

       " 'she swayed and i laughed in wonder at her haunches,\\n\\nbut her waist prompted my tears.',\n",
       " 'as the porter stared at her, he lost his wits and the basket almost fell from his head.',\n",
       " '‘never in my life,’ he repeated, ‘have i known a more blessed day than this!’ the girl who had answered the door said to the other, who had brought the provisions: ‘come in and take the basket from this poor porter.’ so the two girls went in, followed by the porter, and they went on until they reached a spacious, well-designed and beautiful courtyard, with additional carvings, vaulted chambers and alcoves, and furnished with sofas, wardrobes, cupboards and curtains.',\n",
       " 'in the middle of it was a large pool filled with water on which floated a skiff, and at its upper end was a couch of juniper wood studded with gems over which was suspended a mosquito net of red satin, the buttons of whose fastenings were pearls as big as or bigger than hazelnuts.',\n",
       " 'from within this emerged a resplendent girl of pleasing beauty, glorious as the moon, with the character of a philosopher.',\n",
       " 'her eyes were bewitching, with eyebrows like bent bows; her figure was slender and straight as the letter alif; her breath had the scent of ambergris; her lips were carnelian red, sweet as sugar; and her face would shame the light of the radiant sun.',\n",
       " 'she was like one of the stars of heaven, a golden dome, an unveiled bride or a noble bedouin lady, as described by the poet:\\n\\nit is as though she smiles to show stringed pearls,\\n\\nhailstones or flowers of camomile.',\n",
       " 'the locks of her hair hang black as night,\\n\\nwhile her beauty shames the light of dawn.',\n",

       " '‘why are you standing here?’ she said.',\n",
       " '‘take the basket from the head of this poor porter.’ the provision buyer or housekeeper came first, followed by the doorkeeper, and the third girl helped them to lower the basket, after which they emptied out its contents and put everything in its place.',\n",
       " 'then they gave the porter two dinars and told him to be off.',\n",
       " 'for his part, he looked at the lovely girls, the most beautiful he had ever seen, with their equally delightful natures.',\n",
       " 'there were no men with them and, as he stared in astonishment at the wine, the fruits, the scented blossoms and all the rest, he was reluctant to leave.',\n",
       " '‘why don’t you go?’ asked the girl.',\n",
       " '‘do you think that we didn’t pay you enough?’ and with that, she turned to her sister and said: ‘give him another dinar.’ ‘by god, lady,’ said the porter, ‘it was not that i thought that the payment was too little, for my fee would not come to two dirhams, but you have taken over my heart and soul.',\n",
       " 'how is it that you are alone with no men here and no pleasant companion?',\n",
       " 'you know that there must be four to share a proper feast and women cannot enjoy themselves except with men.',\n",
       " 'as the poet says:\\n\\ndo you not see that four things join for entertainment –\\n\\nharp, lute, zither and pipe,\\n\\nmatched by four scented flowers –\\n\\nrose, myrtle, gillyflower, anemone.',\n",
       " 'these only become pleasant with another four –\\n\\nwine, gardens, a beloved and some gold.',\n",
       " 'there are three of you and so you need a fourth, who must be a man of intelligence, sensible, clever and one who can keep a secret.’\\n\\nthe three girls were surprised by what the porter said, and they laughed at him and asked: ‘who can produce us a man like that?',\n",
       " 'we are girls and are afraid of entrusting our secrets to someone who would not keep them.',\n",
       " 'we have read in an account what the poet ibn al-thumam once said:\\n\\nguard your secret as you can, entrusting it to none,\\n\\nfor if you do, you will have let it go.',\n",
       " 'if your own breast cannot contain your secret,\\n\\nhow is it to be held by someone else?',\n",
       " 'and abu nuwas has said:\\n\\nwhoever lets the people know his secret\\n\\ndeserves a brand imprinted on his forehead.’\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen the porter heard what they said, he exclaimed: ‘by god, i am an intelligent and a trustworthy man; i have read books and studied histories; i make public what is good and conceal what is bad.',\n",
       " 'as the poet says:\\n\\nonly the trustworthy can keep a secret,\\n\\nand it is with the good that secrets are concealed.',\n",
       " 'with me they are kept locked inside a room\\n\\nwhose keys are lost and whose door has been sealed.’\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen the girls heard this quotation, they said: ‘you know that we have spent a great deal of money on this place.',\n",
       " 'do you have anything with you which you can use to pay us back?',\n",
       " 'we shall not let you sit with us as our companion and to look on our comely and beautiful faces until you pay down some money.',\n",
       " 'have you not heard what the author of the proverb said: “love without cash is worthless”?’ the doorkeeper said: ‘my dear, if you have something, you are someone, but if you have nothing, then go without anything.’ at that point, however, the housekeeper said: ‘sisters, let him be.',\n",
       " 'for, by god, he has not failed us today, whereas someone else might not have put up with us, and whatever debt he may run up, i will settle for him.’ the porter was delighted and thanked her, kissing the ground, but the girl who had been on the couch said: ‘by god, we shall only let you sit with us on one condition, which is that you ask no questions about what does not concern you, and if you are inquisitive you will be beaten.’ ‘i agree, lady,’ said the porter.',\n",
       " '‘i swear by my head and my eye, and here i am, a man with no tongue.’\\n\\nthe housekeeper then got up, tucked up her skirts, set out the wine bottles and strained the wine.',\n",
       " 'she set green herbs beside the wine-jar and brought everything that might be needed.',\n",
       " 'she then brought out the wine-jar and sat down with her two sisters, while the porter, sitting between the three of them, thought he must be dreaming.',\n",
       " 'from the wine-jar that she had fetched she filled a cup, drank it, and followed it with a second and a third.',\n",
       " 'then she filled the cup and passed it to her sister and finally to the porter.',\n",

       " 'the porter took the cup in his hand, bowed, thanked her and recited:\\n\\nwine should be drunk beside a trusted friend,\\n\\none of pure birth from the line of old heroes.',\n",
       " 'for wine is like the wind, sweet if it passes scented flowers,\\n\\nbut stinking if it blows over a corpse.',\n",

       " 'pour it for me; this is the water of life.',\n",
       " 'he then went up to the mistress of the house and said: ‘lady, i am your slave, your mamluk and your servant.’ he recited:\\n\\nby the door there stands a slave of yours,\\n\\nacknowledging your kindly charity.',\n",
